         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>And now, dear Friends, I being ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Wiſe Conduct, and Vertuous Life, of my dear Husband, whom God hath ſeen meet to diveſt of this Earthly Houſe and Tabernacle, that he might poſſeſs a moſt ſure Houſe and Building with God, Eternal in the Heavens, that glorious Manſion, which the bleſſed Lamb, whom he faithfully followed in his Day, hath prepared for him, where he now reſts from his <hi>Labours, and his Works fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him.</hi> And as one that had full Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him for many Years, cannot but commemorate ſomething of my Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as a <hi>Mite</hi> amongſt many faithful Brethren, caſt into the <hi>Treaſury,</hi> and left
<pb facs="tcp:42082:6"/>upon Record, as a Teſtimony for him; and can ſay, He was a Man of Vertue from his Youth, altho' of a Child I knew him not, he being in Chriſt before me; yet nigh from the Time of my Convince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which hath been for the ſpace of Twenty Six Years, and more; he being at the firſt Meeting I was at, when I received the Truth, altho' I cannot ſay I was begotten into the Faith by him as a Father, yet can ſay, he was to me a faithful Inſtructor, and a Furtherer of me in the Work of God, as well by Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation as Miniſtry: His Love to me was great in thoſe days, for the Work's ſake which God had begun in me.</p>
                  <p>He, with <hi>James Harriſon,</hi> had drawings to viſit Meetings in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> and I went with them; which Journey was of great Service to me in my young Days, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a Time of Service to many in that County; many were Convinced that Journey, and many young ones ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and refreſhed; many drawings about that time had he had into that County of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and of great Service it was; the Lord wonderfully bleſſed his Labours, and there remains many Seals of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry; amongſt which, was my dear Brother
<pb facs="tcp:42082:7"/>
                     <hi>John Low,</hi> who was Convinced of the Truth, and lived and dyed in It, a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Man; alſo his dear Wife, Children and Servants, beſides many that way; at which the Prieſts began to Rage, and <hi>prepare War,</hi> becauſe many refuſed to put into their Mouths, <hi>and could Buy their Merchandize no more,</hi> receiving the Invitation that was free; <hi>Come, buy Wine and Milk, without Money and without Price:</hi> It was a glorious Time indeed; and by the plenteous Preaching of the Goſpel, the Lord opened many Hearts to receive it, as he did the Heart of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> of old, and the <hi>Word of God</hi> grew in our Hearts, that had received it in Love; and the Lord opened my Mouth, and touched my Tongue as with a <hi>Live Coal</hi> from his Altar, that I might teſtifie to that <hi>Word of Life,</hi> that Converts the Heart, and gives Underſtanding to the Simple: In this Time was he very Helpful, and of great Service to me; being always rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to lend an Hand of Help to weak ones, to promote every good Word and Work.</p>
                  <p>About that time, I with my Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, <hi>Elizabeth Hodſon,</hi> went to viſit Friends in ſome parts of <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> and he brought us on our way as far as <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:42082:7"/>where we had a good Meeting, where <hi>William Ellis,</hi> and ſome others, were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced; there he left us, and we travelled ſome Weeks in that County, and had good Service for Truth; and returned, Truth proſpering, and Zeal and Ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for it in our Hearts encreaſed.</p>
                  <p>About this time the Lord raiſed a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of Love in our Hearts, each to other, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to <hi>Marriage;</hi> In which Concern, we felt the Lord's ſpecial Hand to order us: It continued betwixt us for the ſpace of five Years; we never Created Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to diſcourſe it, nor any Journey on purpoſe was made about it, during that Time; yet in the Way of Providence we met together ſometimes, in which we had ſome Diſcourſe, the Lord ſtill eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to us his good Pleaſure therein; in which time we laboured in our reſpective Gifts in the Work of the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> being truly united in Spirit, and daily ſenſible of one another's Exerciſes; though much abſent one from another outwardly, he being concerned in Travels, in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of the Goſpel; though much a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, yet the Lord made way for the Work's ſake, that he travelled in many Parts of this Nation, both <hi>North</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:42082:8"/>
                     <hi>South;</hi> as alſo through the Nation of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where he took Sickneſs, which was then ſome Exerciſe to me, being at ſuch a diſtance, but the Lord ſhewed me that at that time he ſhould not Dye; and (bleſſed be the Lord) he returned well, with the Reward of his Labours, Peace and Satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>After that, he ſtayed a while, and viſited the Churches up and down in <hi>England,</hi> where the Lord wonderfully bleſſed his Labours, many were convinced, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Chriſt Jeſus their Teacher; and the Convinced were ſtrengthned and built up together in that moſt holy Faith, which gives Victory over the World; and when clear of theſe Services here, he went up to <hi>London</hi> to the <hi>Yearly-Meeting,</hi> and found drawings for <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Germany;</hi> which after the <hi>Yearly-Meeting</hi> was over, he faithfully anſwered, together with <hi>Roger Longworth</hi> his Companion at that time; the Lord greatly bleſſed his Labours, and made them effectual to many; the ſame time I was at <hi>London</hi> with him, at the <hi>Yearly-Meeting,</hi> where we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed together, being devoted to the Work and Service of God, which the Lord bleſſed, and us in it. I, with dear <hi>Mary
<pb facs="tcp:42082:8"/>Warrel,</hi> travelled from <hi>London</hi> weſt-ward, through ſeveral Counties; as, <hi>Hampſhire, Dorſetſhire, Devonſhire,</hi> as far as <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> ſo back to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: The Lord was with us, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed our Labours, and we return'd in Peace.</p>
                  <p>After our return Home, my dear Friend returned back from <hi>Holland</hi> that Winter; and about this time the Lord gave us to underſtand our Concern of <hi>Marriage</hi> was near to be accompliſhed betwixt us, in which we had regard to the Lord's Hand and Counſel: It was compleated the Spring following, the 6th Day of the 3d Month, 1682. before ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny faithful Friends, and others; the Lord's glorious Preſence and Power was with us, as a Crown upon his Ordinance: And as we had evidence in our ſelves of the Lord's hand with us, guiding us in that Affair; ſo the Lord raiſed up his Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the <hi>Word of Life</hi> in others. And, I may further ſay, The Lord who joyned us together, bleſſed Us when together, ſo that we lived in great Love and Peace, 14 Years and five Days, in which time we were never ſtraitned one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, always of one Heart, and of one Mind, purely knit together in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb facs="tcp:42082:9"/>of Life, ſo that the Grave hath not broken our Fellowſhip, it goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Grave, where we can enjoy the Spirits of the Juſt; the Separation that is made, is only of Bodies, not of Spirits, Praiſes to God therefore.</p>
                  <p>My dear Husband, as he was a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Man, ſo was he a growing Man, doubled his Talents, and encreaſed his Gifts, both as a Miniſter, and as a Help in Government in the Church; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very Skilful, and Wiſe therein, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled many Affairs comfortably in the Church, not only in our own County, but Neighbouring Counties: I may ſay of him, He was wholly redeemed from the World, altogether the Lord's, in all Reſpects given up to him; I ſaw his Growth daily, and ſometime rejoyced in it, yet in my Joy there was ſome Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs, looking he was nigh the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Gifts, and in a little time muſt go to his Rewards. The ſence of this came upon me with Sorrow, when he was laſt in <hi>Holland,</hi> which occaſioned me to turn over all Affairs, to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I had given the Lord occaſion to withdraw ſo great a Bleſſing from me; but, bleſſed be the Lord, I found all
<pb facs="tcp:42082:9"/>Accounts ſtraight, and no Rebuke upon my Spirit any way, having always gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him to the Lord, according to that Promiſe I made before I took him by the Hand, before ſo many Witneſſes; which was, <hi>To give him to the Lord, as long as he lived;</hi> which the great Lord, before whom only I promiſed, helped me to the performance of, ſo that my Heart was never ſtrait there, through our time; and I may further ſay, as freely as I gave, ſo freely was I given to the Lord; my dear Husband often expreſſing his great Love to me, above all Viſibles, as the beſt of enjoyment he had in this World; yet would ſay, I was not too dear to give up to ſerve the Truth, becauſe in it, I was made a Bleſſing to him, more comfortable every Day than other; he would often expreſs it, and truly ſo was he to me, every Day, every Way, and in every Reſpect; no Tongue nor Pen can relate the full of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Joy we had in God, and one in another: Yet we find ſuch hath been the Pleaſure of God concerning them he hath loved, to try them in the moſt near and dear Enjoyments, that it might be manifeſt he was loved above all,
<pb facs="tcp:42082:10"/>that no Gift, or Gifts, may be preferred above the Giver; but that he may be all in all, and over all, who is, and is to come, God bleſſed for ever and ever. And truly there hath been great Care and Watchfulneſs, one over another, and over our own Spirits, to ſee that our Love, though great, was bounded and kept within its Compaſs, the Truth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its Original, the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: Although it hath been the Pleaſure of God to try me, in the removal of ſo great a Bleſſing from me; ſure it is, that I may be the more inward to him, and have his Love always in my Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, who gives, and takes away, and in all, Bleſs his Name. My Soul travels that I may always follow his footſteps, of Self-denial, in all things, that I may finiſh my Courſe in this World, to the Glory of God, as he did, and have my part in that Manſion of Glory with him, eternal in the Heavens; though it be my Lot to ſtay for a time in this World of Troubles, yet I have hope in Immortality and Eternal Bleſſedneſs, when time in this World ſhall be no more.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:42082:10"/>
                  <p> My dear Husband was a Man very Laborious in his time; though he had ſeveral long weak Fits of Feavers and Agues, yet when a little well, regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Lord's Buſineſs above all: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his Travels about home, and here in <hi>England,</hi> he travelled through <hi>Scotland,</hi> and twice in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> ſince we were Married; and had great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices for the Lord in many Places, as I doubt not but Accounts may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and through Mercy, for two Years laſt had his Health well, and is gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his place, like a Shock of Corn in its due Seaſon, and reſts with the Lord for ever.</p>
                  <p>I have ſometimes conſidered the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denneſs and manner of his Removal; although it was ordered by Providence, that I was far remote at that Time, in in the Service of Truth, which was with his free Conſent and Approbation, being brought on my Way by him, ſo far as <hi>Talk-Hill</hi> in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> where we parted in great Love and Sweetneſs, the Glory of the Lord reſting upon our Spirits; in which, Breathings aſcended up to the Lord for each other: And though I ſaw not his going away, yet
<pb facs="tcp:42082:11"/>have ſeen in what he went, that it was full of Zeal and Fervency in the Love of God, and Life of Righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>So in pure Submiſſion to the Will of God, I conclude this ſhort, but true Relation, of my Worthy Dear Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, whoſe Name and Memorial is bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and will live, and be of a ſweet Savour in the Hearts of the Righteous through Ages: I am Truths Friend, and a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſher to the Souls of all People,</p>

                  <p>WE are deeply affected and bowed in Soul, in a ſenſe of the Lord's free Love and Goodneſs unto us, in look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon, and viſiting us in the time of our Uncleanneſs, when we were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the leaſt of his Mercies; Oh! then was his Arm revealed for our Help, Redemption and Salvation; a Work of ſo great Kindneſs as ought ever to be had in Remembrance, in that neither we, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:42082:12"/>Inſtruments to work the appointed work of our Day: And under this tender ſenſe, we found our Hearts open to give the Salutation of unſeigned Love to all our dear Friends, where theſe may come, with this brotherly Exhortation, That you may all ſtir up one another to the Duty you owe unto the Lord; that as a Church and People of our God's peculiar gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you, and we, may be preſented to him without Spot or Wrinkle. And dear Brethren, the dealings of the Lord with his Inſtruments, and faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and the removing of them from us, hath conſiderable Weight upon our Spirits, and raiſeth a holy Deſire in us, that we, and you, may not abate, but encreaſe our Zeal, Diligence and Labour, that the Lords good Work begun, may not ſtop, but go on and proſper, and that the great Lord of the Harveſt may never want faithful Workmen.</p>
                  <p>Next hereunto, O Reader, We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to thy peruſal, this following Account of our ſaid Friend, <hi>Roger Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> As touching the manner of his Life, we having ſeveral of us known
<pb facs="tcp:42082:12"/>(and converſed with) him from the time of his Convincement, can ſay of it, His Converſation was without Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of Self-denial he was a good Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, in Habit Plain, in Meats and Drinks very Temperate, and in his Actions and Concerns Careful, that what he did might anſwer the better Part in all, and juſtly offend none; Walking (he would often ſay) he preferred before Talking, and laboured that others might walk as they had Chriſt for an Example.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to his Miniſtry (though we need ſay little, becauſe it was known in moſt places where theſe may come) We have from good Experience this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to give, That he preached the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel freely, both in this and other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, always poſſeſſed with a Care that Life and Vertue might put him forth, and manifeſt him to his Auditors; very weighty and deep things did often drop from his Mouth; and although he had ſometimes ſharp Arrows to ſhoot at <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> and againſt all Hypocrites and Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-Minded, yet many times a Living Sweet Conſolating Stream was conveyed through him, to water the tender Plants,
<pb facs="tcp:42082:13"/>and very often a Morſel to the Poor and Needy. Very tender and kind to his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Labourers; yea, to the leaſt Child, that from a right Concern opened a Mouth for the Lord; and for the ſakes of ſuch, did many times ſit whole Meetings through in Silence, very kind in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Strangers; yea, ſuch was the Care of this good Man, that Friends might truly reap benefit in their Meetings, that in many of our Week-day Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings he uſed to wait amongſt us in Silence, that none might too much depend upon Words, or be ſurfeited through the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude thereof: And when at any time he had upon him a Concern to viſit Churches in remote Parts, his manner was to lay before, and wait for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of this our Meeting, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times occaſioned a weighty Senſe of his Service to ſpring among us. Many were convinced by him: We have not heard of any of his Travels, but ſome became Seals of his Miniſtry; in all this, as he did, ſo do we, attribute the Glory to God, whoſe choſen Veſſel he was.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As this our ſaid Friend was called to Believe, and to Receive, a part
<pb facs="tcp:42082:13"/>of the Miniſtry, ſo did he joyfully em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Sufferings, as a part of his Calling, and on the account thereof; we, ſeveral of us, having been his fellow-Priſoners, can with much certainty Teſtifie, that he never turned his back, or gave ground to Truth's Adverſaries in his Teſtimony, but chearfully ſuffered Bonds, as well as Spoil of Goods, as the Lord permitted him to be tryed therein: We can further add, that all his Sufferings he underwent with great Simplicity, as well as Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the Lord's hand alone without Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Contrivance, being truly regarded, eyed, and depended on, for his Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo that he was made to Triumph in the Lord for his Deliverance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The next part in which he was evidently manifeſted to us, to be a Workman who needed not to be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, was his ſingular Care and watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs over the Flock of God, amongſt whom he was not only a good Apoſtle, a Miniſter of the Spirit, but a careful Over-ſeer, an Inſtrument to Prune, Dreſs, Fence in, and keep Clean, that the Church of God might be kept in its Beauty, and wear its own Livery, even
<pb facs="tcp:42082:14"/>even the <hi>White-Linnen without Spot or Wrinkle.</hi> We are truly ſenſible his Care and Labour tended to this. He was a very ſeaſonable and conſtant Attender of theſe our Meetings, as well as others; oftentimes was he opened amongſt us in a ſhort Teſtimony, in God's Wiſdom, ſuitable to the occaſion; Cautious, that neither he, nor any amongſt us, might obſtruct the Days Service by enlarging therein. Weighty and Clear he was in handling the Concerns of Truth; yea, ſtudious to propagate its Intereſt with all his Strength; very Zealous that nothing might remain in the Churches, either to be a ſtumbling-Block, or occaſion our Poſterity to enquire why theſe things were left. All Superfluities of Meats, Drinks, Apparel and Furniture, as well as Feaſtings at Births, Marriages and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, and other needleſs worldly Cuſtoms, he lived to ſee put a ſtop to, and which he in the Lord's hand was made an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to effect. He would with Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, Clearneſs and Plainneſs, go through weighty matters, and in handling was very Righteous; for, though he was of an humble Condeſcention, to hear the mind of the leaſt Member, yet would he not
<pb facs="tcp:42082:14"/>ſubmit the juſtneſs of a Matter, or leſſen his Judgment, or the Stroak of Truth upon it, for the Intereſt of either Friend or Brother; and as ready he was to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelf, where he either miſ-appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, or was miſ-informed: In this manner (we cannot forbear to tell it) was he converſant amongſt us, a good help in Government, for which ſake we truly honoured him; and on behalf of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Lord had laid upon him, relating to the Diſcipline of the Church, we can ſay to the Praiſe of God, that what he recommended to Friends Practice in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces abroad, as he fell in their Monthly and Quarterly-Meetings, not taking effect, to be complyed with in his Life-time, hath ſince his departure from us, been put in Practice by them, and a Benefit found thereby; ſo that <hi>being Dead, he yet Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aketh;</hi> his Life and Spirit, Bent and Inclination, have ſtill their Motion in the Minds of many. Much more might be truly ſaid, to the Praiſe of that Vertue that dwelt richly in him; but our deſign was Brevity in this Undertaking, and our only Aim therein, the Exaltation of that Grace, by which he was what he was, to God, his Church and People.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:42082:15"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> As to his Death, It was ſudden and ſurprizing to us, in that not above three Days before it, he ſeemed in full Strength, both of Body and Mind, and bare amongſt us a living Teſtimony to that Univerſal Grace, and Sufficiency of it, by which we were called, and in which, all have Life, Salvation and Peace, and exhorted Friends to avoid every thing that would gender to Bondage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Day following he fell Sick (as was ſuppoſed) of a malignant Fever, which continued violent upon him for about two days and a half, and then dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Preſence of many Friends. His Body was accompanied by a great number to Friends Grave-Yard in <hi>Penketh;</hi> after the interring of the Corps, was a very large Meeting, many more than the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Houſe could contain, ſeveral Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies were born, and a ſolid Weight of Divine Goodneſs over-ſhadowed the Meeting, ſo that we may ſay, Precious in the Eyes of the Lord is the Death of his Saints. And now, tho' our loſs of ſo faithful a Friend and Fellow labourer cannot but affect us very nearly, yet in this we are ſatisfied, that in the good Pleaſure of God he is taken from us: And
<pb facs="tcp:42082:15"/>tho' he might according to the Courſe of Nature have lived many more Years; yet as to his Growth and Ripeneſs, we can ſay of him, He died in a good Old Age, having lived to behold his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry and Services crowned with the Converſion of many to the Faith, and Eſtabliſhment therein. And we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a full ſatisfaction, that his Reſt is glorious amongſt his Fathers, even faithful <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the Followers of the Lamb, there to Sing Praiſes to God on high, who is Worthy for ever and ever.</p>

                     <hi>A few Lines, by way of Teſtimony, from Friends in</hi> Cheſhire, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Dear</hi> Roger Haydock, <hi>Deceaſed.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THough we believe that many Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies will be given from ſeveral Faithful Friends, concerning that good Man, yet we that have reaped ſo great a Benefit from his Labours, in Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and other ways, cannot keep wholly Silent concerning him: For ſoon after he had received a Gift for the Miniſtry, he found himſelf concern'd to viſit This County, and where, in his firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, he was very gladly, received; for he proved very Serviceable to many that waited for the Redemption of <hi>Zion;</hi> and greatly helpful, in ſtrengthening and incouraging thoſe, whoſe Faces were turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thither-ward. Thus meeting with ſo pleaſing a Reception in his early Viſits, found himſelf ingaged to come often a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us; and he greatly grew, and was filled with the Life and Power of God; and his Service was much inlarged, and very many were awakened, that had fallen aſleep in a kind of Self-ſecurity,
<pb facs="tcp:42082:16"/>who were ready to cry out, What ſhall we do to be ſaved! For they were prick'd to the very Heart. So prevalent was his Teſtimony, ſo powerful was Truth.</p>
                  <p>And indeed ſeveral were Convinced, and with great gladneſs received the Teſtimony of the Word of Life; who, with thoſe many more, that were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupported and ſtrengthened by his Labours, as Living Epiſtles, can ſet to their Seals, to the Truth of his Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
                  <p>Now our County being thus alarmed, and ſtirred up, and the beauty of many pleaſant Pictures fading, and Truth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpering and inlarging it ſelf in many places: The Men of the <hi>Long Robe</hi> begun to be angry (for now ſome Member or Members withdrew from their Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and joyned themſelves to the poor deſpiſed <hi>Quakers</hi>) This ſo inraged them, that they made their Pulpits ring with the Noiſe of the Danger of the Growth and Infection of <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> and Exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Black Charges againſt us, and our Principles, at random, to frighten poor People from receiving the Truth of God.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:42082:17"/>
                  <p> Some of which being taken notice of, occaſioned ſeveral Publick Diſputes in this County: And in Vindicating of our Holy Profeſſion, againſt theſe our Oppoſers, this our Friend, of whom we are wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, did more <hi>particularly</hi> appear. And truly the Lord's Preſence and Power ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared with, and ſo enabled him, that he not only clear'd up thoſe Truths, clouded through their Envy, but ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly returned their Charges upon themſelves, that ſome were Convinced by thoſe opportunities, and ſeveral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed: In all which, he behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as a Man for God. The Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance whereof is very ſweet to many of us, to this moment. And indeed all along to his end, he forgot not his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Care over us; ſo that above many others, we are really indebted to his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, who hath been greatly Service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to us, and hath done Valiantly.</p>
                  <p>His Travels have been conſiderable, in this and foreign Nations; of which we might inlarge, but ſhall leave it to other Pens; as alſo, to ſpeak of his Parts and Accompliſhments, which were very conſiderable; And not to be tedious, ſhall only add, He Lived well, and ſo
<pb facs="tcp:42082:17"/>he Died; and his Work being finiſhed, was taken from us in the ſtrength of his Age, of whom the World was not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy: And was attended to his Grave by ſome Hundreds, and many good and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Teſtimonies were born, to the Praiſe of that Power, that had raiſed him up to be ſo ſerviceable to the Churches of Chriſt, to the great Comfort of thoſe many Mourners preſent at his Interment; and he being Dead, yet Speaketh.</p>

                  <p>IT is ſuch as Die in the Lord, who are Bleſſed; being gathered to their Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Reſt, with the Spirits of Juſt Men made perfect; and freed from Tears and Sorrows, and manifold Sufferings, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels and Labours, and whoſe Works fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them; whoſe Names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life, amongſt the Living, and is a ſweet Savour and bleſſed Memorial to after-Ages: And though we, that are yet left behind, may have loſs, in that they are outwardly removed from us, yet ought therein to be content, ſince it's the good pleaſure of the Almighty, and the great Gain of them who are ſwallowed up in the Joy of the Lord un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable; of which number, it's my preſent Senſe and Teſtimony, our dear Friend and Brother, <hi>R. H.</hi> is one, and has finiſhed his Courſe here with Joy; who, in his day, was a Man of God, a
<pb facs="tcp:42082:19"/>faithful Man for the promoting the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of God, his Truth and Righteouſneſs; given up to ſpend, and be ſpent, in the Service of the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in all Faithfulneſs and Sincerity, as well as plentifully Furniſhed thereto, by him that hath the Infinite Treaſures of Wiſdom and Divine Knowledge, and gives freely thereof to the Humble and Sincere in Heart; and richly was this dear Man of God furniſhed for the Work of the Miniſtry, which he was called to, and found Faithful in, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Years, to the finiſhing of his Courſe here; and a Bleſſed Effect his Living and Powerful Miniſtry had upon the Hearts of many, not only in turning them to the Lord's Way and Truth, but alſo in Confirming, Building up, and Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing many therein: Being one of thoſe Scribes, commended by our Lord, who are <hi>well inſtructed unto the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and bringeth forth out of his Treaſure things New and Old,</hi> for the Inſtruction, and Building up others; many in this Nation, and many others, where he Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled, can Teſtifie and bear Witneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: Who are the Living Seals of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, having good cauſe, with thankful
<pb facs="tcp:42082:19"/>Hearts, to bleſs the Lord on the behalf thereof.</p>
                  <p>It's not with me to inlarge into the particular Travels and Labours of this Faithful Servant of the Lord, in this and ſeveral other Nations; ſuppoſing that may be the Work of others: But as I well knew him, and had an intimate and inward Acquaintance with him, from the time that it pleaſed the great God of Eternal Glory, to call, ſanctifie, fit and furniſh him to the Work of the Miniſtry (which is moſt of Thirty Years) by our often and frequent Travels together in that Work and Service, in moſt parts of this Nation: So that which I have in ſhort, to ſay and teſtifie herein, with reſpect to God's Glory, Service of his Truth and People, and Diſcharge of Duty, to and on the account of ſo Dear, ſo Faithful, and ſo greatly Beloved a Friend, Brother and Companion; is from Tried, and long Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and certain Knowledge, as I felt it to ſpring and live upon my Mind, in that Love and Life, in which my Heart was firmly United to him, as was <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan</hi>'s to <hi>David.</hi> Very ſhortly after I had the Heavy Tidings and Sorrowful Account, of his being taken out of the
<pb facs="tcp:42082:20"/>Body, and ſo removed from us, as to outward Appearance; under which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe I could not but mourn, and ſay, Ah my Brother! I have a Loſs of thee, the Flock and Family of God has a Loſs of thee, and other Worthies, at this time removed: The Lord be intreated to pour out a double Portion of his Spirit upon us, leſt behind, and raiſe up many more; that ſo his Work may become Proſperous in the Earth, <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oh how Comfortable is the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of that perfect Love, Nearneſs and Unity, that we enjoyed together, without the leaſt Jarr, which made our Service and Labour together very eaſie and pleaſant, and our Converſation toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very ſweet! And know, that he was Open-hearted, Free and Faithful to his Friend; a great Lover, as well as Promoter, of Love, Peace and Concord amongſt Brethren; able in Advice, ſound in Judgment, tender and kind to the Weak, every way ready to ſerve and help the Needful in every reſpect; of a truly Humble and Lowly Spirit, giving Preference to others, eſpecially Elders;
<pb facs="tcp:42082:20"/>although a Man that had a kind of Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Preſence, in a Manly Carriage or Deportment; from which ſome might miſtake him, that knew him not in the Root of Life and Truth; Fervent in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Zealous for the Promotion of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Truth, in a Godly-Diſcipline and Goſpel-Order amongſt all Friends; and his Care and Labour, that all might be found in the Practice of the pure Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on profeſſed, That ſo <hi>Zion</hi> might become Glorious, <hi>the Praiſe of the whole Earth;</hi> and the Church and Family of God be kept Pure and Chaſte, to ſhine forth in her Splendor; the Eclipſing whereof, in any reſpect, I know was ever his Exerciſe; and under the Exerciſe thereof, have ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathized with him in Sorrow and Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whom I knew eſteemed of, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the Peace, Proſperity, Wellfare and Increaſe of the Glory of <hi>Zion,</hi> God's People, far above his own. His Natural Parts were great, and augmented by a good and liberal Education: All which being Sanctified, as well as Inlarged, by the Power of Truth, made him both Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and Serviceable in the Church of Chriſt, in many reſpects. And tho' he be Dead, yet Lives and Speaks amongſt
<pb facs="tcp:42082:21"/>us, and is Enjoyed in that Life which never Ends. And as he has turned ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to Righteouſneſs, he now ſhines as a bright Star in the Firmament of God's Power; and his Name will be of Laſting Remembrance amongſt the Living.</p>

                     <hi>H. M</hi>'s Teſtimony concerning our dear and faithful Friend, <hi>Roger Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock,</hi> Deceaſed.</head>
                  <p>AMongſt many of the Lord's Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, whom, in this our Day, Age, and Generation, he hath endued with Wiſdom, Courage, Valour and Prevalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, in Innocency and Righteouſneſs, to make War, without Carnal Weapons, againſt the Spiritual Enemies of God, and of his Son Chriſt Jeſus, the Lamb without Blemiſh, that taketh away the Sin of the World, this our dear Friend <hi>Roger Haydock</hi> was not one of the leaſt; who, before I knew him, was (at the Challenges of Prieſts, that oppoſed the Truth, to which he bore Teſtimony) ſeveral times engaged in Diſputations, as Defendant for the Truth, profeſſed and lived in by him, and the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> againſt the falſe Charges of the Prieſts: One Paſſage whereof being related to me, by one of the party adverſe to him, when I was a Stranger to the Truth, and to <hi>Roger Haydock,</hi> tended to my Convincement; and in hopes it may likewiſe be of good
<pb facs="tcp:42082:22"/>effect to others, I ſhall here inſert it, <hi>viz.</hi> My Neighbour told me, he had been at a Diſpute between Mr. <hi>Cheyney</hi> (as he called him) and a <hi>Quaker,</hi> whom I have ſince known to be <hi>Roger Haydock,</hi> and and that <hi>Cheyney</hi> (among other things) charged the <hi>Quakers</hi> for not uſing Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of Infants: Then I asked him, how the <hi>Quaker</hi> anſwered to that? He ſaid, Indeed the <hi>Quaker</hi> behaved himſelf very moderately and civilly, in his way, and anſwered, That there was no Proof in the Scriptures of Truth for it; and that it was only Men's Invention, and by Man's Tradition that they held it; and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering how they uſed it, who profeſſed the Scriptures to be their Rule, which did not warrant them therein, it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them to be ridiculous, both before God and Man. Then I asked him, What Proof <hi>Cheyney</hi> brought for it? He anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this effect, That he did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that <hi>Cheyney</hi> brought any Proof for it. This Relation induced me to ſeek for what Proof could be found for it; becauſe I had been taught, that my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm was the Foundation of my Chriſtianity; thereupon diligently ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures, and after that, reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:42082:22"/>with my Teachers, I plainly ſaw there was no Proof from the Scriptures, nor Authority from Chriſt, to be found for it; and that therefore my Foundation was unſound, and the Building upon it dangerous and ruinous: Therefore in a deep Senſe of my want of a Foundation that could not be moved, I left the Builders upon Infant-Baptiſm, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly ſought unto the Lord, who, in his own time, Revealed in me that Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which ſtandeth ſure, even the Rock of Ages, the Foundation of all the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Righteous; that great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery hid from many Profeſſors, which is <hi>Chriſt in Believers, the Hope of their Glory,</hi> who Baptizeth them with Spiritual Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Fire; a <hi>Manifeſtation of whoſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is given to every Man to profit withal;</hi> which inwardly Reproveth the Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, but Comforteth the Faithful, who in it have true Unity and Fellowſhip one with another: And in this I was in the Lord's time acquainted with this my aforeſaid dear Friend and faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Chriſt, whoſe Service the Lord made of good effect to me, by the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Relation, of one that was as an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary to him, and that a conſiderable
<pb facs="tcp:42082:23"/>time before I knew him; for about the time that I left the aforeſaid Builders, my Teachers, he was concerned in the Lord's Service in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the Year 1680. He was Laborious in the Service to which the Lord, by his Grace, had called him; and for which he had fitted him, in giving him largely to know and underſtand the deep Myſteries of his Kingdom, and filling his Treaſure with the durable Riches and Righteouſneſs thereof. And as he plenteouſly and freely received of the Lord, ſo it was his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and great Concern, in the Counſel of God, freely to give and impart Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Gifts to others, that many might be enriched with the ſame. And therefore through great Travels, Sufferings and Exerciſes, he cheerfully went in the Lord's Service, who bleſſed his Labours, ſo that he was Inſtrumental in the Lord's Hand for the turning of many from <hi>Darkneſs to Light, and from Satan's Power to God.</hi> He was neither ſparing of Himſelf, nor his Subſtance, to ſerve the Lord the Giver, who bleſſed him as well with Temporal as Spiritual Bleſſings; of both which he was very free, in the Love of God, to communicate; having an eſpecial Care
<pb facs="tcp:42082:23"/>over the Poor, that none might want; and a tender reſpect to the leaſt appearance of Good in any, that it might be incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged: He was concerned for the general Good of all, but eſpecially Serviceable in the Church of Chriſt; being as a Pillar in the Houſe of God, firm and ſtable, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the Weak, and edifying the Houſhold in Love: His Miniſtry, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Lord's Power, hath often hit my Condition aright, to my benefit, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and comfort: He was a Skilful Labourer in God's Vineyard, knowing as well how to refreſh, water, and gather in due ſeaſon, as to prune and keep up the Fence: He was a Skilful and Valiant Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier of the Lamb, in Innocency, ſhooting God's Arrows aright againſt <hi>Babylon,</hi> and his Bow abode in its Strength: He was not afraid of the Archers that ſhot at him, having on the <hi>Shield of Faith,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled their envious Darts: His Fighting was not with Carnal, but Spiritual Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, under the Banner of Chriſt, his Captain, which is Univerſal Love; in which Love he was rooted and grounded, and flouriſhed like a freſh and fruitful Tree, more and more to the end of his time. I was with him at a Meeting the
<pb facs="tcp:42082:24"/>day next before his Sickneſs began, being but three days before his departure; in which Meeting, the Lord's Wiſdom and Power in a great meaſure appeared with him, opening many excellent things by him; and his Service therein was great, treating very fully and clearly of the ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Diſpenſations of God towards Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, in the ſeveral Ages of the World, according to the ſeveral States and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions thereof; in order that Mankind, that had been in a loſt and eſtranged Eſtate, in Tranſgreſſion, might come again to be reconciled unto, and acquainted with God, their Creator, and with him enjoy Everlaſting Peace and Happineſs: Shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo, <hi>That God, who at ſundry times, and in divers manners, by his Angels and Prophets, ſpoke unto Mankind formerly, hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken to his People by his Son, whom he hath appointed Heir of all things;</hi> by whom alſo he made the World; who, in the fulneſs of time, came in the Body prepared for him, Born of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary,</hi> in which he ſpoke and did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny excellent things, and ſuffered many things, yea, even unto Death; leaving to all that ſhould believe in him an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they ſhould follow his ſteps;
<pb facs="tcp:42082:24"/>who laid down his Life for their Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation to God, and Redemption from all Iniquity. And alſo, according to the Scriptures, he very clearly and largely declared and teſtified, That the largeſt, cleareſt, and moſt general and excellent Diſpenſation of God's Love, in his Son Chriſt Jeſus, is (as it was in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles time) in this our Age and Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in and by the Light and Spirit of Chriſt, manifeſted in and unto his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who walk in Faithfulneſs and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience thereunto, to which he Exhorted all; and the Praiſe and Glory of all he aſcribed to God, whoſe Honour he ſought, and not his own. The ſubſtance of which ſound Declaration, and living Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, by the Lord's Power that attended it, was ſo Imprinted in my Mind and Memory that day, that I believe I ſhall never forget it: So the Lord, who had made him comely, both outwardly and inwardly, and adorned him with a meek, low, and quiet Spirit, and with Wiſdom, clearly to diſcern the deep things of God, in a great meaſure, and to divide the Word of Truth aright, in tender Love and ſound Judgment, was with him to the end of his time; and when he had
<pb facs="tcp:42082:25"/>accompliſhed his great Service, which the Lord called him unto, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied him in, and bleſſed with ſucceſs, to the good of many, he, having fought the good Fight, and kept the Faith, and finiſhed his Courſe, laid down his Head in Peace, and Died in the Lord, the righteous Judge; whoſe Croſs in his time, he having cheerfully born, now enjoyeth the Crown of Everlaſting Life and Righteouſneſs; and being at reſt from his Labours, his Works follow him; and the Teſtimony of his Works, Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and Services may be of Benefit and Service in the Generations to come, and his ſweet Memorial will Live with the Juſt for ever.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>AS touching this my dearly beloved Friend, I cannot eaſily be ſilent, but expreſs ſomething in Teſtimony con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, for a three fold Reaſon:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe the Lord made him an Inſtrument to Preach the Word, by which my hard and unbelieving Heart was reached and tender'd; for although I had heard the Truth preached before, by ſome Friends, yet it was no more than a Wonder to me, remaining ſtill in gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying; until it pleaſed God by his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry to open my Heart, to receive the Word ſpoken by him; by his explaina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Prayer our Lord taught his Diſciples, and ſhewing who had right to call God Father, was I convinced; at which I often marvelled, remembring my Zeal (in my young Years) for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating of it, according to Tradition; yet ſo it ſeemed good to the All wiſe God, in whom I have believed; and do reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
<pb facs="tcp:42082:26"/>Bleſs his Name, for ſending his Meſſenger of Glad-tidings, to Proclaim the acceptable Day, and Preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; for which, at that time, he ſuffer'd Bonds and Impriſonment, having only obtained Liberty for a little ſeaſon, which he beſtowed in viſiting the Churches. I am (through Mercy) amongſt others, a Seal of his Miniſtry, which he was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as well as prudent, to adorn in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, uſing ſometimes (in familiar Diſcourſe) to ſay, <hi>He that Preaches abroad, let him Preach at home.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He was ſelf-denying for the Truth's ſake, he was always in a Care, and often in Admonition, leſt any ſhould diſhonour the Truth, by out-going, or diſorderly walking, whoſe Expreſſion (ſometimes) was, <hi>To Walk in Truth, was better than to Talk of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe of my knowledge of him, after my Convincement; it falling to my lot, of later time, to be a Member of that particular Meeting he belonged to; in which time he ſhewed, that in him had God ſettled a Care, as well to Build up in the Faith, as to beget to it; help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to further and promote Vertue in us
<pb facs="tcp:42082:26"/>all, and in no wiſe Cenſorious as to the Teſtimony of young Friends, nor frown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whether they appeared before or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him: Yea further (without boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) I may ſay, he was a Man greatly fearing the Lord, apt to Teach, prudent to Adviſe, as well as able to do it: I obſerved (in difficult matters) few too hard for him, but by that Wiſdom that was in him, he had ſtrength to go th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ow it: So that his Death was a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſal, as well as a felt and known Loſs, to the Churches amongſt whom he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently converſed; and becauſe thereof, was their Hearts affected with Sorrow. It may appear by his <hi>Journal,</hi> he made uſe of his time, leaving Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and Temporal Affairs, to viſit the Churches in theſe and other Nations.</p>
                  <p>My <hi>Third</hi> and <hi>Laſt Reaſon</hi> that hath been a motive to give this brief Relation, is, That near and true Reſpect I bore to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him in his Service amongſt us; in ſo much, that with a tendered Mind, I now remember him; and a ſence of his Spirit, my Heart tenders: And though to him to Dye is Gain, yet to us Loſs. But who may ſay to God, What doſt
<pb facs="tcp:42082:27"/>Thou? Or, Why is it Thus? But rather ſtrengthen our ſelves in the Lord, that we may, according to our Memberſhip, be more capable to ſerve the Lord and his People, as we had him and others for Examples; it was a Portion of the Lord's Spirit that made him a Worthy in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> that hath made me at this time thus Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie of him; ſo that I can ſay, He <hi>being Dead, yet ſpeaketh.</hi> God by his goodneſs grant to raiſe many ſuch helps in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to the dignifying of his Name, which this our dear deceaſed Friend ſought.</p>
                  <p>Since I have known Truth (above twenty Years) and obſerved the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of ſuch as were in Chriſt before me; I have beheld few (if any) more remote from ſelf-Praiſe or Exaltation: I believe (while in this Tabernacle) I ſhall not forget his Advice to me, the firſt opportunity I had with him, after I was convinced by him <hi>(viz.)</hi> Not to <hi>Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute any thing to Man, but give God the Glory;</hi> and with what Reverence and Gravity theſe things were expreſſed; his Humility at that time reached the better part in me, and I hope will remain as a Nail faſtned in a ſure Place: My Prayer to the Lord is that he may raiſe many
<pb facs="tcp:42082:27"/>ſuch Miniſters in his now <hi>Iſrael;</hi> to the furtherance of his Name, Truth and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; and that many may be willing (as he was) to ſpend and be ſpent, to go to and fro, that Knowledge may be increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                  <p>What I have already teſtified of this my Father and Friend (for in his Bonds he begat me) hath eaſed my Spirit; I loved him dearly in his Life, and no leſs at his Death, whoſe Savour reached to People of all ſorts, and his Death lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I was ſeveral times with him in his Sickneſs, and was concerned in Mind to go down a little before his Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo that with many good Friends I was preſent, and ſaw him put off this outward Tabernacle, though to our Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; yet in a full perſwaſion that he died the Death of the Righteous, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for that future felicity, which a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs Number is following after, which neither Hell, nor Death, Beaſt or falſe Prophet, ſhall be able to hinder. <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Although I could further Amplify and Enlarge this my Teſtimony, yet ſhall deſiſt, with Real and Ardent Deſires to
<pb facs="tcp:42082:28"/>the Lord, that he may order our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation aright; and that all that names the Name of Jeſus may depart from Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and be ſanctified to reign with the Righteous World without End,</p>

                  <head>William Ellis's <hi>Teſtimony concerning dear Friend,</hi> Roger Haydock,</head>
                  <p>I Have much in my Heart, concerning our dear Friend, <hi>Roger Haydock,</hi> tho' I cannot expreſs to the full what I know of him; but, however, I ſhall ſay the leſs, not queſtioning but that there are Teſtimonies in the Hearts of many Friends, to his Worth, and Faithfulneſs, and Service, in the Bleſſed and Holy Truth, wherein we have believed, and felt the Bleſſed Effects of our Faith, to the great Comfort and Conſolation of our Souls.</p>
                  <p>It was about twenty one Years, the laſt 3d Month, ſince I was Convinced of the Bleſſed Truth: And though I have ſince that day had many Inſtructors <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> yet I have not many Fathers; for <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus</hi> was I begotten, by him, through the Goſpel, and the Operation of the Holy Spirit, which did Effectually open a door of Entrance in my Heart, as it opened a door of Utterance unto him: It was at a Meeting at <hi>Bradley,</hi> near <hi>Skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:42082:29"/>in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> where he declared the Day of God, which was broken forth in this Age, in great Splendor to Enlighten Mankind; he ſpoke many things which reached the States of many in that day, alluding from the State of <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, who paſſed through the Sea, and ſaw the wondrous Works which the Lord wrought for their Deliverance, yet ſome forgot him, and made themſelves Idols of their Jewels and Earings; ſaying, <hi>Theſe be thy Gods, O Iſrael, who brought thee out of the Land of</hi> Egypt; <hi>and then ſat down to Eat and Drink, and roſe to Play:</hi> With many more precious Words, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he did ſound forth the glorious Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; I was abundantly ſatisfied that day, with what I had felt and heard: So I took heed unto the Word in my Heart, unto which I had been directed by him; and it grew and Increaſed, and my Faith Increaſed, and I became, according to my ſmall Meaſure, obedient thereunto; and my Soul was in love with the Truth, and the Followers thereof, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with him who had been the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of publiſhing the ſame to me; his Feet was indeed beautiful unto me, and I could ſay in Truth, <hi>Bleſſed be him
<pb facs="tcp:42082:29"/>that Cometh in the Name of the Lord:</hi> I ſaw his Zeal, and was ſenſible of the Sincerity of his Heart, and Endeavours in his Life-time, to promote, to his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, the great Name of God.</p>
                  <p>And when (through Providence) I came to be more Intimately Acquainted with him, I was confirmed in my ſenſe of him, and his Love to God, and Zeal for the Truth, and have in many private Opportunities with him, been abundantly ſatisfied in the ſweet Society and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip we have injoyed together; and I am fully perſwaded that his <hi>Root</hi> was in the <hi>Truth,</hi> and that he was ſenſible that the <hi>Root</hi> bore him, and he grew therein; and laboured much to bring <hi>People</hi> to be eſtabliſhed upon the <hi>Sure Rock, Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the <hi>Root of Life,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the <hi>True Church</hi> is Built: And I know his Labours in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect was great, and the Lord ſaw his Faithfulneſs, and poured out upon him the Spirit of Wiſdom and Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and of a ſound Mind, to promote Good Diſcipline and Comely Order in his Church; that She might be like the <hi>True Church</hi> of Old, which <hi>John</hi> ſpoke of, under the Similitude of <hi>A Woman,
<pb facs="tcp:42082:30"/>who was clothed with the Sun, and had the Moon under her Feet:</hi> Which Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry did far Excel the Glory that attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Solomon</hi> in his beſt State; for the ſake of which, the Queen of the <hi>South</hi> came far, and was overcome with the Sight thereof.</p>
                  <p>Thus did he Labour and Travel in his Day, ſpending himſelf, that the Church might be adorned with the Comely Attire and Ornaments of the Holy Spirit, and that the Name of the Lord Jeſus, her Head, might ſpread to the Ends of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>Bleſſed be the great God of Heaven and Earth, that raiſed up him, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more, who could hold the Sword, and be Expert in the War; like the (<hi>Cant.</hi> 3.7, 8.) <hi>Threeſcore Valiant Men of Iſrael,</hi> who <hi>kept the Bed of</hi> Solomon: Or, like the <hi>(Judges</hi> 20.15, 16.<hi>) Men of</hi> Benjamin, <hi>who could Sling to an Hairs Breadth, and not miſs.</hi>

                  <p>ALthough I heard that ſome Friends had Intentions to Write ſomething by way of Teſtimony, as a Memorial of this Servant of Chriſt, above named; yet upon Conſideration, I did not find my ſelf clear and eaſie (though delayed for a time) except I did caſt in my <hi>Mite</hi> amongſt the reſt, having had knowledge of him, ſince he was convinced, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Truth, which was in the Year 1667, ſince which time, I obſerved that he was ſtill in a growing Condition in the Truth, to his laſt End, as a Tree planted near the River of Life, in God's Garden, which was always Green, whoſe Branch withered not, but ſpread over the Wall, that they without might be induced to come in, to be made partakers of the Fruit of the bleſſed Vine, Chriſt, (in due ſeaſon) as faithfulneſs to the Call and Gift of God was lived in.</p>
                  <p>He was a Man that had good Will for all, and true Love, eſpecially to the Houſehold of Faith, Poor or Rich; was
<pb facs="tcp:42082:31"/>no Reſpecter of Perſons in thoſe Caſes, but had an Eye to the Inward State and Condition, ſo that as Truth did encreaſe and proſper in any, his Love encreaſed; for it was his great delight to ſee Truth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper, and Friends in it, for he loved Friends for Truth's ſake: God endued him with Wiſdom from above, that he had a ſenſe of Inward States, ſo that he could divide the Word aright; Bread, and ſweet Wine for Obedient Children, and Judgment for the Rebellious: But with ſuch Wiſdom and Moderation, that gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon many of them, ſo as to conſider what it was they rebelled againſt, even the Light of Jeſus Inwardly, diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which is Evil.</p>
                  <p>He certainly learn'd of Chriſt to be Meek and Low in Heart, very clear from an exalted Spirit, but ready to be a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to the leaſt Child: I believe it was pleaſant to him to be doing Good; he was a Man given to Hoſpitality himſelf, and very Careful of the Poor; I heard him once ſay in a Meeting, upon occaſion, <hi>We have enough, let not the Poor want.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He was a Man of good Utterance in his Declaration, and the Goſpel he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he lived in, and preached it Freely,
<pb facs="tcp:42082:32"/>as he had Freely received it from God; it was the Power of God, that comes over the Power of Satan, in Man: His Doctrine dropped as the Dew and ſmall Rain, to the refreſhing of the tender Buds and Branches in the Vine, Chriſt, and comforting the ſtronger that did abide therein; he was an Help and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to the Caſt-down, of which I have ſome Experience; and although he was younger than I, yet I had a great eſteem of him for Truth's ſake, and did honour him as an Elder; yea, with double ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, for he was worthy; who ruled his own Houſe well, and took care of the Church of Chriſt: I have been often up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſion in his Family, and never law better Government in any Family, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I came, than there: He hath left a good Example behind him to his dear Wife, who obſerveth it diligently.</p>
                  <p>He was faithful in that Work God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him unto, which many are Witneſſes of, in his own Native Country, beſides his Services in other Nations, as, <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Ireland, Holland</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He hath been ſeveral times a Sufferer for Truth, but never daunted, but reign'd in Authority, in the Power of God, as
<pb facs="tcp:42082:32"/>a King, over the Power of Darkneſs and Perſecution, which was no more to him, than a little Duſt under his Feet.</p>
                  <p>I was with him in a Meeting, where ſome in Office (as was ſaid) aſſiſted with a great Company of Rude Fellows, with great Staves, making a noiſe like Mad Men, finding him at Prayer, had like to have pulled him off his Knees, but were ſomething reſtrained, of which he too<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> no notice; but when he did riſe, they laid hold on him, and hurried him away out of the Meeting, with an how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling noiſe, like a Company of Wolves that had made a Prey upon a Lamb, for ſo he behaved himſelf; all which did not ſo much touch nor hurt him, as to alter his Countenance, as I perceived: But after the Rude People were gone, Friends continued their Meeting; and there being ſome from ſeveral Meetings, we had a good Meeting; for the Power of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was driven away, and the Enemies blinded. And this was at <hi>Freckleton,</hi> in the <hi>Fylde,</hi> where there is now a ſettled Meeting, and hath been for ſeveral Years. He was alſo Priſoner for the Truth at <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter-Caſtle</hi> ſeveral times.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:42082:33"/>
                  <p> Now, in as much as I am fully ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that his Spirit is Crowned with Life Eternal in Heaven (where my Spirit, in ſome Meaſure, hath unity with him, as he is brought to my Remembrance) Why ſhould not his Name, which is precious, be kept in a living Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance from one Generation to another, for the ſtirring up others to follow him, as he followed Chriſt? That over all, God may have all the Honour, the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the Praiſe, who alone is worthy; for this my Friend, in his Life time, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſought it to himſelf, but ſought the Honour of God only.</p>
                  <p>He was of excellent Service in theſe parts where he lived, upon Truth's Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; but what he did, it was by the Aſſiſtance of God's Holy Spirit and Grace given unto him, ſo nothing to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to Man, tho' he was a good Man; for out of the good Treaſure of his Heart, he brought forth good things.</p>
                  <p>He was of a Noble Spirit, a Perſon Prudent in Matters, and the Lord was with him; his Company was Pleaſant, and his Diſcourſe Profitable.</p>
                  <p>I may hope that none will be offended with me, that I give ſo much Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
<pb facs="tcp:42082:33"/>to God's Workmanſhip, both In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and Outward, that God may have the Honour and Praiſe of his own Work: And when he, according to the Will of God, had finiſhed his Courſe, the Lord was pleaſed to favour him with but a ſhort Sickneſs: He had his Accounts rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, he laid down his Head in Peace, and dyed in the Faith, the 11th day of the 3d Month, 1696.</p>

                  <p>OUR Faithful and Well-beloved Friend, <hi>Roger Haydock,</hi> was Born of honeſt Parents, who were of good Repute in the World; and concerning him I have this Teſtimony to bear, from a certain Knowledge I had of him, for I knew him ſoon after he was Convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and received the Knowledge of the Truth; and I then took great notice of him, he appearing in great Humility, and under a great Inward Exerciſe and Travel of Spirit, before he appeared in a publick Teſtimony for the Truth, which was about the Year 1669. At which time, a great Power and clear Life was ſhewn forth in him, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his day, it being a day of the Revelation of the great Power of God, and of his Powerful Word of Eternal Life; of which, this our faithful Friend was a Miniſter; to which work the Lord by his Grace had called him, and he freely gave up, and devoted himſelf to that Service; for which the Lord had
<pb facs="tcp:42082:34"/>well fitted and qualified him, and made him of great Ability through the Spirit, giving him ſound Knowledge, and deep Diſcerning, to find out the Myſterious Workings of the Enemy of Mankind, ſo that he was very skillful to divide the Word of Truth aright. And at that time there was great Service to be done for the Lord, for then many had ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Deſires after the Knowledge of God, and were Seeking and Enquiring after the way of Truth, which leadeth to Eternal Life; and to ſuch he was an Helper, and faithful Inſtructor in the Lord Jeſus; and being zealouſly Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that he might compleat the Work and Service that the Lord had called him unto, and promote the Intereſt and Honour of God, and be Inſtrumental for the good of many of the Children of Men; He went under a great Concern and Exerciſe of Spirit, through great Travels, Sufferings and Labour of Body, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel of Chriſt freely, that many might be turned to God, and gain the Knowledge of him, and be gathered into the one Fold and Paſture of Eternal Life, out of the By-Ways, and Dark
<pb facs="tcp:42082:35"/>Paths, and Vain Religions of the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-minded; and ſo might know a coming out of Darkneſs, and a walking in the true Light, and way of Life and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that they might pleaſe their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and anſwer the end of his Love, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in his Son, and manifeſted in the Light: And the Lord, who imployed him in his Service, bleſſed his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours therein; for many received his Teſtimony, and thereby were turned from Darkneſs to Light, and out of the Paths of Error, into the Way of Righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>His Labours and Travels are in part declared by his <hi>Journal,</hi> which ſheweth his Travels in ſeveral Countries and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſometimes amongſt People of a ſtrange Language: A bleſſed work he went through in faithfulneſs unto the End.</p>
                  <p>He was a great Helper, and of great Service in the Church of Chriſt, and his Labours and Miniſtry therein were very ſucceſsful; he was often prevalent to end Differences and Diſcord, where the Enemy had ſown any amongſt Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: His Doctrine received of the Lord was ſound, and deep Matters were
<pb facs="tcp:42082:35"/>often opened by him, and it was his delight to do Service for God, and to help the good Work forward in any; he being earneſtly concerned that all that knew God, might <hi>Glorifie him as God:</hi> And the Lord bleſſed him, whilſt here, with ſuch Mercies as appertain to the making of a Man's Life Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable in this World, which the Lord ſaw (no doubt) he was worthy of; who richl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> recompenſeth all thoſe that Love him, and Seek his Honour, and the Welfare of his Church, as this our faithful Friend did, and his Memorial will be long upon the Earth amongſt the Generations of the Righteous.</p>
                  <p>I might write much concerning him, and his Vertuous Life, which was Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Honourable, and of a loving and friendly Behaviour amongſt Men: His Company was Pleaſant and Profitable, and many were ſorry to part with him.</p>
                  <p>But though his Removal hence be a loſs to many, yet I am well aſſured that he hath gained thereby, and is in the enjoyment of Peace, and of an endleſs Treaſure in Heaven, amongſt the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Bleſſed, with Chriſt in his
<pb facs="tcp:42082:36"/>Kingdom; and being at reſt from his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, his Works follow him: And it is my earneſt deſire, that we who are left behind (which is but for a little ſpace) may ſo improve our Time and Gifts, that in the end, we may have a Share of the ſame Reward, that is laid up for all the Faithful.</p>

                  <p>IN Love unfained do I Salute you, and in the Fear of God Exhort you to Faithfulneſs, and in the Word of the Lord Counſel you, To be Watchful in your Meetings, that the weighty Work and Service of God, which he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned you in, be not ſlighted by any of you, through Unfaithfulneſs, and want of Watchfulneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Friends,</hi> The Seed which God hath ſown is good; if you be watchful, it will grow and proſper, and cover the Ground, and the Earth will be bleſſed: But if you ſleep, the Enemy will ſow Tares, which will grow up with it, and choke it; ſo the Ground that affords them nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be curſed. This is the Word
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42082:37"/>of Truth unto you; ſo as in Love to the Seed which is good, and in Bowels of Compaſſion to your Immortal Souls, which are of great Price in the ſight of God, deſiring the Seed's Proſperity, and your Souls Good, in the ſenſe of its Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, and of the Deprivation of God's Love unto you, who, in this Incumbent Duty of Watchfulneſs, have been negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent; it hath been upon me many times, in the Motion of God's Spirit, to Reprove your Negligence, and likewiſe Exhort and Admoniſh you to Faithfulneſs, in that Duty, whilſt converſant with you; even ſo, ſince remote from you, outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeparated, and under Bonds reſtrained, the ſence of the Non-performance of that ſo weighty a Duty, on your behalf, who are herein concerned (whereby God's Righteous Soul hath been vexed, and the Spirit of the Upright and Sincere-hearted to God, amongſt you, have been made ſad) hath ſometimes come before me, to my grief; and yet remaineth in my view, to the ſaddening of my Spirit, who am truly a well-wiſher of <hi>Zion,</hi> and one (though outwardly confined) yet travels for the Proſperity of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in Spirit, which is at liberty (which Man
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42082:37"/>cannot confine.) Therefore it entered my Heart, in the Word of Truth, to ſignifie God's Counſel unto you, That ye be watchful, that the good Seed which God hath ſown may grow deeply, having depth of Earth, even room in the honeſt Heart; that it may bring forth, in ſome <hi>Thirty,</hi> in ſome <hi>Sixty,</hi> in ſome an <hi>Hundred fold;</hi> but in all of you, ſome to his Praiſe; leſt the Enemy ſow his Seed, and it grow, (and the Ground be nigh unto curſing) whoſe end is to be burned.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Friends,</hi> another word hath often run thorough me, when preſent with you, That you <hi>Love one another;</hi> and the ſame word is in me, though I be from you, whereby I know the Cauſe yet remains in you: And truly I may take up a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation for you, who are concerned, who will not be counſelled: How often hath the Lord ſtriven with you? How, often hath his Word been ſpoken unto you? And how often hath his Servants laboured amongſt you? And do you yet live in Strife and Contention? Truly I am ſorry for you, and that the precious Truth is diſhonoured by you; it is a grief upon my Spirit, and upon the Spirits of the Upright-hearted among you: <hi>If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42082:38"/>you have an Ear to hear,</hi> hear; put away Strife, Envy and Contention, and labour a Reconciliation in the Love, if ſo be the Lord's Anger may be appealed, which is kindled againſt you, becauſe of theſe things, and you periſh not in his hot Diſpleaſure.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Friends,</hi> You who are <hi>Called,</hi> and <hi>Choſen,</hi> and <hi>Faithful</hi> (for a Remnant of ſuch I know there is amongſt you, who keep your Garments unſpotted of the World, anſwering the Pure in all) Dwell you in the Feeling of the weighty Life, which hath ſeaſoned you, that in it you may Read me, Feel me, and Embrace me, in the Arm of my Father's Love, even as you are Read, Felt and Embraced; that tho' outwardly ſeparated, yet in that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable Bond of Unity; in which we are One, and our place One, even with the Son, to behold his Glory; we may lie down together, and Solace our ſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in the Overcoming of our Father's Love, whoſe Care is over us, and whoſe Love flows towards us: To whom be Glory for Ever and Ever.</p>

                     <p>And whereas he ſaith, Many will not endure ſuch Preachers as he: I add, No doubt.

                  <p>IT is not a Narrative of the Diſpute I had with <hi>John Cheyney,</hi> at <hi>Arley-Hall</hi> in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> upon the 23d Day of the 11th Month laſt paſt, that in this Treatiſe I am purpoſed to give; for that would require an impartial Reiteration, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Relation, of all that was ſpoken on both parts; which Task I am unwilling to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe I have not <hi>John Chey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>'s Crutch, which he leaned upon at the ſaid Diſpute; I mean his <hi>Notes,</hi> which he Diſputed by (he may well bear

C.</hi> in his aſſaying to prove his falſe Charges.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly.</hi> Becauſe ſomething of what the Lord gave me that day to ſpeak in defence of the Truth, is not now in my Remembrance, it being ſome Months ſince the Diſpute; and I had not Notes to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute by, like <hi>J. C.</hi> neither did I put Pen to Paper concerning it, or premeditate before hand what to ſay; that not being Truth's Way, nor according to Chriſt's Command, but expreſly contrary, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.19, 20. <hi>Take no thought how or what ye ſhall ſpeak, for it ſhall be given you in that ſame hour what ye ſhall ſpeak: For it is not ye that ſpeak, but the Spirit of the Father which ſpeaketh in you:</hi> But I was reſigned in the Will of God, and ſtood in his Counſel; and it was given me of God
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42082:51"/>(whoſe Preſence was that day with me, who bleſſed my Undertaking concerning that Diſpute; to him alone be the Praiſe) what to ſpeak in Defence of the Truth; whereby the Truth was cleared, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and their Religion, defended, from <hi>John Cheyney</hi>'s wicked Charges againſt both, and <hi>J. C.</hi> proved a Lyar and a Deceiver. Something of what was ſpoken-by-me, which had then its Service, is not now in my Remembrance, ſo as to give a particular Account of every word I then ſpoke: Therefore it's not a Narrative of the Diſpute I intend, but an Examination of <hi>J. C</hi>'s falſe Relation, given concerning the ſaid Diſpute, is chiefly hereby intended, in order to detect his Lyes, that the Truth may appear, in which Examination I ſhall relate ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of what was ſpoken; and, for clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things to the <hi>Reader,</hi> ſhall further declare my fence, as the Lord opens things in me.</p>
                  <p>But before I come to Examine <hi>J. C</hi>'s Relation of the Diſpute at <hi>Arley,</hi> I muſt intreat the Reader's patience (by the way) to go along with me, in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of <hi>J.

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42082:52"/>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Wareham,</hi> and <hi>Roger Haydock,</hi> a <hi>Quaker.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I think it expedient, for the opening the Matter, to give the Reader a brief Relation how this Diſpute was occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that it may appear, I did not Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge a Diſpute with this Mr. <hi>B.</hi> (as <hi>J. C.</hi> calls him) whoſe Name is <hi>John Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;</hi> a thing I am clear of, though of late I have been twice concerned in Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (yet as Defendant) through the daring Challenges the <hi>Prieſts</hi> have given, amongſt whom this <hi>J. C.</hi> of all others, hath exceeded; of which ſomething more hereafter.</p>
                  <p>About the middle of the 4th Month, 1676. I was in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> at a Meeting of God's People, at a place called <hi>Kingſley,</hi> where there were ſome People lately Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the Truth; ſome of which were Pariſhioners, and had lately been Hearers of the ſaid <hi>J. B.</hi> Prieſt of <hi>Wareham;</hi> to which ſaid Meeting alſo reſorted ſeveral of the ſaid Prieſt's Hearers.</p>
                  <p>After the Meeting, I went that Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſome Friends to <hi>Croton,</hi> being about a Mile diſtant from the place where the Meeting was; where a Friend, late one of <hi>J. B</hi>'s Hearers, did acquaint me,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42082:52"/>That <hi>J. B. raged ſore againſt the</hi> Quakers. I replied to the Friend, <hi>It was the manner of ſome</hi> Prieſts <hi>ſo to do, where Truth ſpreads, and where ſuch as had been their Followers were convinced, and turned from them.</hi> The Friend did farther acquaint me, That <hi>J. B. railed in his Sermons againſt the</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, <hi>charging them to be led by the ſpirit of Antichriſt; and that it was the ſpirit of Antichriſt they directed People to;</hi> or words to this purpoſe; <hi>and that ſome who heard him, being diſſatisfied therewith, did afterward ſpeak of it; and</hi> John Barber <hi>being ſpoken to, he did aſſert it again, and challenged to make it out againſt any</hi> Quaker <hi>that would meet him before a Congregation of People.</hi> After I had heard the <hi>Friend,</hi> I ſpoke ſomething to him, as not to mind what the <hi>Prieſt</hi> ſaid; for I hoped he, and the reſt, who were convinced of the Truth, were ſatisfied the <hi>Prieſt</hi>'s Charge was falſe: He ſaid, <hi>He was ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; but ſome, who had heard of the Prieſt's Challenge, were deſirous he ſhould be met:</hi> Farther adding, That <hi>if he ſhould not be met, he and many others would boaſt, as tho' the</hi> Quakers <hi>durſt not Diſpute with them.</hi> I would have put the thing ſtill from me, it being croſs to the Inclination of my own Mind; and I being engaged for ſeveral
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42082:53"/>Days in Truth's Service, which was the occaſion of my being in <hi>Cheſhire</hi> at that time (though I was not altogether eaſie concerning it) ſo I left it that Evening, not giving the Friend farther anſwer. Next Morning it was upon my Mind, and the Friend again ſpoke of it; ſo it reſting pretty much before me, I bid the Friend write down what he heard the <hi>Prieſt</hi> ſay, which he did; and the words were to this effect, <hi>John Barber</hi> ſaith, <hi>He hath ſaid it, and will ſay it again, That the Light and Spirit the</hi> Quakers <hi>are led by, and direct People to, is the ſpirit of Antichriſt; and that of any of the</hi> Quakers <hi>would meet him, he would eng age to prove, it by Diſputation, before an Aſſembly of People.</hi> The Friend that writ had alſo heard <hi>J. B.</hi> repeat and vindicate it.</p>
                  <p>When I had read it, it was in my Heart to write a few words under it, which was to this effect:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Friend, if this be thy Aſſertion, and that thou wilt, according to thy Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, undertake to-prove it by Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, before an Aſſembly of People, againſt any <hi>Quaker</hi> that will meet thee, then Subſcribe thy Name to it; and I do undertake, on the behalf of the Light and Spirit the <hi>Quakers</hi> are led by, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42082:53"/>direct People unto, to meet thee, and ſtand by the Defence of the Truth, againſt thy wicked Charge; leaving to my Friend <hi>John Low,</hi> the Bearer hereof, with thee to agree of Time and Place:</q> To which I ſubſcribed my Name.</p>
                  <p>Time and Place was agreed upon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>J. B.</hi> the Opponent, and my Friend <hi>J. L.</hi> on my behalf, who was to be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, which was to be at <hi>Croton,</hi> the 20th of that Inſtant, the 4th Month, 1676.</p>
                  <p>To which Place appointed came <hi>John Barber,</hi> in order to prove his Charge, and to his aſſiſtance <hi>John Davis,</hi> Prieſt of <hi>Frad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham,</hi> and <hi>John Cheyney,</hi> Prieſt of <hi>Burton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi>-Chappel; theſe were Opponents.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John Cheyney</hi> gives ſome Relation him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, of his coming to this Diſpute, in p. 1, 2. of his <hi>Warning to Souls;</hi> how he was in <hi>ſuſpenſe what do;</hi> he ſays, He <hi>ſought the Lord—determined to go, though not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome doubts in his Mind.</hi> Which gives ground to any wiſe Man to believe, he had not an Anſwer from God, nor a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to go; for, if ſo, what needed he to have doubted? But when he comes to the place, he ſays, <hi>He was no ways engaged in the Diſpute, but came as an Hearer,</hi> where at preſent I leave him.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>J.

                  </p>
                  <p>I denied his Propoſition, That the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> aſſerted the Whole Chriſt to be in them; and aſſerted his Concluſion to be falſe, ſaying, The <hi>Quakers</hi> do not deny the Lord that bought them; yet I owned that Chriſt was in us; to which <hi>J.

                  <p> Now I further add ſome Scriptures, that the <hi>Reader</hi> may take notice thereof, and ſee <hi>J.

But unto every one of us is given Grace, according to the</hi> Meaſure <hi>of the Gift of Chriſt.</hi> Epheſ. 4.7. 2 Cor. 10.13. <hi>Hereby know we that we dwell</hi> In Him, <hi>and he</hi> In Us, <hi>becauſe he hath given us of his</hi> Spirit. 1 John 4.13. <hi>And of his</hi> Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>have we all received, John</hi> 1.16. [Mark] Of Chriſt's Fulneſs have we all received, of his Spirit he hath given us, and Grace according to the <hi>Meaſure</hi> of the Gift of Chriſt. Obſerve, We have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived but <hi>Meaſurably</hi> of Chriſt's <hi>Fulneſs,</hi> of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> according to the good Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God, the Giver; ſome of us more, other-ſome leſs; yet of the ſame Fulneſs, of the ſame Spirit: And though given to us Meaſurably, it is the ſame with the Fulneſs, it is of the Spirit; and whether a larger or leſſer Meaſure or Manifeſtation of the Fulneſs of the Spirit, be by one or another of us received, yet ſtill it remains undivided from the Fulneſs, from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which is inviſible: Neither is the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42082:56"/>Meaſure, Manifeſtation, or Gift of the Spirit of God, the Fulneſs, diſſected or parted from the Fulneſs, but is really of the Fulneſs; One in us all, proceeding from the Fulneſs; One through all, and over all, abiding in the Fulneſs, and ſo of the Godhead; which cannot be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into Particles, nor cut into Shreds or Pieces; for, to aſſert that, were Blaſphemy: Which Aſſertion our Adverſaries have unjuſtly laboured to force upon us, being blinded through Envy, and altogether ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the Glorious Myſtery, <hi>Chriſtian Man the Hope of Glory.</hi> But they have all come ſhort, and we are clear from any ſuch Aſſertion; and farther hold forth, That God is an Infinite Spirit, Omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, an Immenſe God, Immenſurate, yet Meaſureably doth he manifeſt himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, and gives us to partake of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. And ſo we are in Chriſt, and Chriſt dwells in us, and walks in us, according to the Meaſure of his Gift, given us of his Spirit; and we daily grow up in Grace, from Stature to Stature, from one Degree of Holineſs to another, a Habitation for God and Chriſt through the Spirit: And is not this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scriptures?

B.</hi> (I ſuppoſe without his leave, for this was before he ſaith, He gave him leave to propound an Argument) than by the Argument he propounded, he was able to do for him? I leave the <hi>Reader</hi> to judge. Only adding, for his Information, That it is the Light and Spirit wherewith Chriſt lighteth every Man that cometh into the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42082:57"/>World, which the <hi>Quakers</hi> direct People to: This is evident by their Books and Doctrine. <hi>J. B.</hi> aſſerted this Light and Spirit to be the Spirit of Antichriſt: <hi>J. C.</hi> affirmed it to be the Light and Spirit of Chriſt; ſaying, <hi>Every Man is ſo far enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the Light and Spirit of Chriſt, as that he is left without Excuſe.</hi> But <hi>J. B.</hi> in the cloſure of this Aſſertion of <hi>J. C</hi>'s, excepted againſt <hi>Heathens</hi> being ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned. So theſe three Prieſts, all <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal</hi> Prieſts, differed in Principle amongſt themſelves. <hi>J. D.</hi> denied the Spirit to be given by Meaſure: <hi>J. C.</hi> aſſerted, every Man was enlightned with the Light and Spirit of Chriſt: And <hi>J. B.</hi> denied <hi>Heathens,</hi> who are Men, to be ſo enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Again, <hi>J. D.</hi> denied the Light of Chriſt to be <hi>Saving;</hi> but <hi>J. C.</hi> and <hi>J. B.</hi> acknowledged the Light of Chriſt to be <hi>Saving.</hi> Theſe Contradictions of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> were noted down, and ſo kept ſince the Diſpute. And upon theſe Points at the Diſpute I told them, They were like the <hi>Scribes, Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Saducees,</hi> who differed among themſelves, yet joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether againſt Chriſt; and ſo they joyned together againſt us, yet differed amongſt themſelves: Therefore ſaid I, Go, and

                  <p>The Reaſon which induced me to give this ſhort, yet true Relation, is, To in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Reader what Arguments <hi>J. C.</hi> ſaith, we were canvaſſing about the Light within; in which he ſaith, <hi>Many Quakers ſpoke beſide</hi> R. H. and would make his Reader believe on the other ſide, none ſpoke but <hi>J. B.</hi> until <hi>J. B.</hi> gave him leave to ſpeak; when as in the canvaſſing of this Argument there were <hi>J. B. J. D.</hi> and <hi>J. C.</hi> Beſides what was ſpoken by the Standers by, on their part, as well as that there were ſome others beſides <hi>R. H.</hi> who ſpoke on our part.</p>
                  <p>To give a Relation of much of what was ſpoken either by one or other, or ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſides, is not my purpoſe. But ſince <hi>John Cheyney,</hi> over the Heads of <hi>John Barber</hi> and <hi>John Davis,</hi> ſeems to aſſume a Glory of Conqueſt to himſelf, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Diſpute, and would be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body; therefore he never mentions <hi>John Davis,</hi> and only makes mention of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> as he ſtiles him, that he may ſhortly tell his Reader what he hath done; therefore I thought meet to hint a little of what
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42082:58"/>each of the three aforementioned <hi>Prieſts,</hi> as well, <hi>J. C.</hi> as the other two, ſaid; that the Reader may not only hear they ſpoke, but ſee ſomething of what was ſpoken by every one of them (and I thought in moſt ſafe to publiſh what was noted down, and kept ſince the Diſpute) in which I have been as ſhort as I well could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

That many <hi>Quakers</hi> ſpoke beſides <hi>R. H.</hi> and yet on the other ſide none ſpoke but <hi>J. B.</hi> and that until <hi>J.

                  <p>Now I ſhall examine <hi>J. C</hi>'s Account of this Diſpute, which is as followeth:</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>J. C.</hi> tells his Reader, <hi>He propounded an Argument<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the Quakers deny the faithful Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, and his
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42082:59"/>Holy Ordinances, and ſo we not acted by the Spirit of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> If propounding of an Argument were proof, that the Argument propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed were true, then <hi>J. C.</hi> hath done ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, in telling his Reader, He propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Argument, to prove the <hi>Quakers</hi> are not acted by the Spirit of God. But if propounding of an Argument be not proof, as ſure it is not, that the Argument propounded is true, then <hi>J. C.</hi> hath done nothing, as to proof, in telling his Reader, He propounded an Argument to prove the <hi>Quakers</hi> are not acted by the Spirit of God; ſo his Argument ends in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>J. C.</hi> tells his Reader, <hi>He proved the Miniſters, whom the</hi> Quakers <hi>do utterly condemn, and ſeparate from, to be Chriſt's Faithful Miniſters, by this Argument: They teach ſound Doctrine, lead Godly Lives, are duly Called to the Miniſtry, have their Call and Commiſſion from Chriſt; and he Seals and Confirms their Miniſtry with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Souls.</hi> And if his Reader will but take his word for it, he ſays, He <hi>made evident all theſe Particulars, and took off all their Cavils and Exceptions:</hi> And yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if his word may but find credit with

                  <p>This, Reader, is the ſubſtance of what <hi>J. C.</hi> hath done, to prove what lay upon <hi>J.

C.</hi> hath at leaſt charged us to be revolted from the true Miniſters, and I may alſo ſay, At the moſt, but charged us; for he hath proved no ſuch thing: I might write pretty largely, to manifeſt, That neither he, nor any of his Brethren the Prieſts, from whom we have turned away, are faithful Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, neither are truly called to the Miniſtry, nor have Commiſſion from
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42082:61"/>Chriſt. But becauſe it is only the Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of this Account concerning that Diſpute at <hi>Croton,</hi> I here intend, and finding no Tract of his, further to prove, that he and his Brethren are faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt, duly Called and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionated by Chriſt, but his bare Word, which is of little eſteem with many; and it is nothing, though it be ſo; for I know not how that Man, who plays the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, and Diſſembles with God, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Untruth to the Searcher of Hearts, ſhould have eſteem with good Men; for if he will lye to God, he will lye to Men; and what Credit ſhall be given to his Word?</p>
                  <p>And becauſe ſeveral Brethren, whoſe Books are extant in the World, in which theſe things are thoroughly treated of, have fully proved theſe things, which may be ſeen by ſuch as read them; I ſay, many have written, and coplous and plentiful are the Books, in which ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent proof of theſe things may be ſeen, by any who reads them with a ſingle Eye; yet I refer the Reader, who is deſirous to be informed, to a Book enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>The Prieſts and Profeſſors Principles;</hi> and alſo to <hi>William Gibſon</hi>'s Book, enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42082:61"/>
                     <hi>The Life of God, which is the Light and Salvation of men, exalted;</hi> which is an Anſwer to ſix of <hi>John Cheney</hi>'s Books, in which, whoever reads, if ſimple-hearted, may be rightly informed; and in pag. 10. of the ſaid <hi>W. G</hi>'s Book, may read <hi>J. C</hi>'s. own Teſtimony concerning his Church, which agrees not with his fore-cited Boaſt, of their Miniſtry and Doctrine, but contradicts himſelf.</p>
                  <p>So I ſhall leave the Diſpute at <hi>Croton,</hi> that I may examine <hi>J. C</hi>'s Relation of the Diſpute at <hi>Arley;</hi> in which I expect to find him the ſame <hi>J. C.</hi> to boaſt of Victory, though he fled the Stage; which if ſo it prove, it will ſomething reſemble the running Bird, which, when got home, crows aloud upon his own Dunghil.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>J. C.</hi> in p. 1. of his <hi>Warning to Souls,</hi> ſaith, <hi>For ſundry Reaſons he is purpoſed to make a brief Relation of his Diſpute with the</hi> Quakers <hi>at</hi> Arley.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply,</hi> In this the Man is well nigh as good as his word; for of that whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed Treatiſe, which contains twenty five pages, I think there is not above four pages, if collected, of what was ſpoken at that Diſpute; and of thoſe four pages, ſo far as I perceive, not thrice four lines
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:42082:62"/>of what <hi>J. C.</hi> ſays I ſpoke; and of thoſe lines; I think not ſix lines of what I ſpoke; which Lines, had they been left out, then had <hi>J. C.</hi> according to his word, made a brief Relation of his Diſpute.</p>
                  <p>For his Relation made, together with his whole Treatiſe, I find not the recital of a word ſpoken by any <hi>Quaker</hi> in that Diſpute but <hi>R. H.</hi> So that if the thing intended was a Relation of a Diſpute with the <hi>Quakers,</hi> herein <hi>J. C.</hi> hath come ſhort; for <hi>Roger Haydock</hi> is not <hi>Quakers:</hi> but if it was, as I rather think (though miſt in the making) intended to be a Relation of his Diſpute, to tell his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what he ſaid, and what he did, and what a Conqueſt he made, and how the <hi>Quakers</hi> were overthrown (though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was quite otherwiſe) much like his Account of the afore-mentioned Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute at <hi>Croton,</hi> in which there is not one word of what any <hi>Quaker</hi> ſaid; then <hi>J. C.</hi> hath on that hand over-reached; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in telling his Reader, that <hi>R. H.</hi> ſpoke what he ſpoke not; nay, what he ever abhorred to think, <hi>viz. That God did no where command us to walk according to the Scripture,</hi> pag. 21. of his <hi>Warning,</hi> &amp;c. To which at preſent, I ſay, It is
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:42082:62"/>a Lye, and a wicked Slander; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, I ſhall ſay ſomething more hereafter.</p>
                  <p>This is one Character of his Relation, and no queſtion, but if he have that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence, as to make <hi>R. H.</hi> ſpeak as he would have him, he will have Confidence enough to ſpeak what he pleaſes for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in compoſing his Relation, in order to perſwade his Reader, <hi>R. H. was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed and ſilenced, and the</hi> Quakers <hi>were overthrown.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if his Reader be a Wiſe Man, he will not judge of things before the time: <hi>Lyes</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>light, and often ſpread far, and Falſe Reports often get the ſtart, and go before;</hi> and ſometimes that ſide hath cryed, <hi>Victory,</hi> which hath run away; Fools have believed them; but Wiſe Men have waited to know the Truth, who got the Day; and to ſuch, the firſt Report to be falſe (and the Folly of them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it) was made manifeſt in due time.</p>
                  <p>But to come to <hi>J. C</hi>'s Relation, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to examine it, ſo ſoon as I can reach thereunto, it is my purpoſe; but by the way, <hi>John Cheyney</hi> mentions a <hi>Paper,</hi> which I came to him with, the day after the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute at <hi>Croton, which,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>was written
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:42082:63"/>to prevent a Brother of a Godly Acquaintance, who was inclining to</hi> Quakeriſm; in which Paper he ſaith, <hi>He had charged their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to be Antichriſtian and Damnable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply,</hi> This Paper <hi>J. C.</hi> mentions, was ſhewed me by a Friend ſeveral Days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Diſpute at <hi>Croton</hi> (or that I knew to have a Diſpute with <hi>J. B.</hi>) who, for the ſake of the Young Man, then lately Convinced, deſired me to write ſomething in anſwer to it. I peruſed it, and found the Charges very wicked; but there was no Name ſubſcribed to it; ſo I gave it to the Friend again, looking upon it to be no other than a <hi>Reproachful Libel.</hi> The Friend told me, <hi>He believed</hi> J. C. <hi>writ it,</hi> and was very urgent upon the Young Man's account to have it anſwered: Whereupon I ſaid, <hi>Let ſome Friend ſhew it to</hi> J. C. <hi>and if he own it, and will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe his Name to it, ſomething then may be done.</hi> So the Friend took it with him.</p>
                  <p>After the Diſpute at <hi>Croton,</hi> I went for <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> and in <hi>Warrington</hi> met pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntially with ſome Friends, who were about to go to <hi>J. C.</hi> with the Paper; they deſired me to go along with them, at whoſe requeſt I took the Paper, and went with them, ſhewed it to <hi>J. C.</hi>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:42082:63"/>who read it over, afterwards owned that he writ it, but would not ſubſcribe it, neither give it me again, but alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Paper was neither Ours, nor His, but God's; <hi>and Providence having ordered it to his Hand again, he would keep it:</hi> I told him, Whereas he had wronged us, if he would acknowledge it, we would paſs it by: He deſired, after ſome debate about the Paper which he had in his hand, to read it over again; he read it, that the ſtanders by did hear it; afterward he ſaid to one of his Friends, who ſtood by him, <hi>He thought there was nothing in it but what might be ſtood by;</hi> his Friend aſſented to what he ſaid: I told <hi>J. C. It was very unlike a Miniſter of Chriſt, to give forth a Paper as a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and afterward deſire to read it over, to ſee whether he could ſtand by it or not; he ought to have conſidered that, before he gave it forth:</hi> Yet ſtill he refuſed to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, until ſome of our Friends would firſt draw him a Copy of it: If he would have ſubſcribed it, after the ſecond peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal of it, I promiſed he ſhould have a Copy of it, before it went out of the Room; but he refuſed: So I having a Journey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, could not well ſtay longer, but
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:42082:64"/>came away, the Paper ſtill unſigned; yet left with Friends, that if he did ſign it, to ſend it to <hi>Alexander Lawrence</hi> (who was the day before engaged with him in the Diſpute) becauſe I had a Journey to go, and was uncertain of my return home. <hi>J. C.</hi> did afterwards ſign the Paper, and Friends ſent it to me; my return home being ſooner than I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, I met with it, writ to <hi>J. C.</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the whole into ſeven Heads or Charges, which I ſhall here inſert.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>Religion is New, and ſo new that</hi> (he ſays) <hi>he can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſince firſt it came up.</hi> 2dly, <hi>That it is Worldly and Fleſhly.</hi> 3dly, <hi>That it is Bred and Fed by Ignorance and Pride,</hi> 4thly, <hi>That it is Uncharitable.</hi> 5thly, <hi>Its Principles are contrary to Truth and Godlineſs.</hi> 6thly, <hi>It is against God's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the Scriptures, and Chriſt's Miniſters.</hi> 7thly, <hi>That the</hi> Quakers <hi>are ſuch as are deſcribed by</hi> Paul, Rom. 16.17, 18. <hi>who ſerve not the Lord Jeſus Christ, but their own Bellies, and by good Words, and fair Speeches, deceive the Hearts of the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Theſe ſeven Charges I put him upon the proof of, and to give me his eſſayed
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42082:64"/>Proofs under his hand: He writ to me again, evading Proof; I replyed; and ſeveral Letters paſt betwixt us: I put him upon Proof by Writing, his Charges being written; he ſhuffled, one while counting it great coſt to buy the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> Books, and great labour to ſtudy them fully and elaborately to confute our Cauſe; by which I told him, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared he could Charge deeply without buying our Books, or ſtudying them, even at all Adventures; but his Mouth was more open to Charge, than Prove: Another while urging a Diſputation, <hi>it being a ſhort way to put an end to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Strife, occaſioned by his Paper:</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, He would have leſs than full Proof to ſerve us; and ſlubber things over, which is a common thing, when People grow weary of what they have undertaken.</p>
                  <p>I would have kept him to the proof of his Charge by Writing, but he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely refuſed, and challenged a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute, which was conſented to, and agreed upon, to be at <hi>Arley,</hi> as before: When we came upon the Stage, he would have excuſed himſelf, ſaying, <hi>He did not Challenge the Diſpute;</hi> which was a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42082:65"/>Lye, as I ſhall make appear: All Lyes I know are wicked; but his Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs in this exceeded; that though he was guilty, he would have rendered me to be the Challenger of the Diſpute, and himſelf clear: Upon this I earneſtly urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the reading of what Letters had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed betwixt us, which would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided that matter: He refuſed; I told him, if he was not aſhamed to ſtand by what he had written, let the Letters be read; for they would manifeſt who challenged the Diſpure: He ſtill evaded, alledging, together with ſome of his Abettors, <hi>It was but a Shuffle in me:</hi> I reminded him of his Promiſe, which was, <hi>That the Letters ſhould be read,</hi> which would give People an Inſpection into the Matter; to which I engaged him in the embracing of his Offer of Diſputation; he regarded not his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, but broke his Covenant, ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining the reading of them, and labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to perſwade the People, it was Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in me, to keep from the Charge: Whereupon I replyed, <hi>John Cheyney,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs thou challengeſt the Diſpute, and I will paſs by the reading of the Letters, and come to the Paper or Charge, to which
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42082:65"/>he granted; yet the Auditory being large, many did not either hear him, or ſo apprehend him, as afterwards I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. But though at the Diſpute he abſolutely denyed, at the firſt, that he challenged the Diſpute, yet in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, p. 3. he ſaith, <hi>He</hi> provoked <hi>me to a publick Diſpute;</hi> and that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may underſtand how he provoked me, I ſhall give ſome Citations out of his Letters, in which I will not wrong him one Tittle.</p>
                  <p>In his Letter, of Date <hi>July</hi> 24. 1676. he begins thus, <hi>Roger Haydock, if thou be able to defend thy Religion,</hi> John Chey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney <hi>calls thee forth to maintain it.</hi>— And in the ſame Letter, <hi>I would have thee and me to Diſpute it out: Why art thou not as forward to Diſpute with me, as with</hi> John Barber? — Again, in the ſame Letter, <hi>I am conſtrained by the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſs of a declining ſhuffling Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, who calls for Proofs in Writing, and will neither ſay Yea nor No, he will Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute or no, as diſtruſting himſelf, or his Cauſe, or both.</hi> — Once more in the ſame Letter, even to a Tautology, <hi>But what the matter is, I cannot tell,</hi> Roger
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42082:66"/>Haydock <hi>will not yield me an Anſwer,</hi> pro <hi>or</hi> con, <hi>he will or he will not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Likewiſe in his Letter, of Date <hi>Auguſt</hi> 28, 1676. I being under reſtraint for my Teſtimony, he writes thus; <hi>If thou canſt not procure thy Liberty, ſend to any one of thy Brethren,—Chooſe out any one, or one for one day</hi> [Mark] <hi>and another one for another day,—and when thou art at Liberty, ſend to me, and I ſhall be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for thee alſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe, Reader, are ſome of his daring Challenges; I ſhall not trouble thee with my Anſwers thereunto; my intent chiefly being to give thee to under ſtand, that <hi>J. C.</hi> [and not <hi>R. H.</hi>] challenged the Diſpute; and who reads this, that heard <hi>J. C.</hi> that day affirm, he did not challenge the Diſpute, but <hi>R. H.</hi> if not byaſſed in judgment, can do no leſs than conclude, That one of the firſt things <hi>J. C.</hi> inſiſted upon, was a Lye, viz. <hi>That</hi> R. H. <hi>challenged the Diſpute.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That <hi>J. C.</hi> is a Lyar, his Mouth and Pen both beſpeak him ſo to be. (Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the words, <hi>Lye</hi> and <hi>Lyar,</hi> thou mayeſt bear, being plain Engliſh words, and uſed in Scripture) For he hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and written as many Lyes and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42082:66"/>as ever any I have heard or read of, who have aſſumed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Title of <hi>Goſpel-Miniſters;</hi> if they were all collected which I have heard from his own Mouth, and read in his Books and Papers, the Catalogue thereof would fill up ſeveral Pages; ſome of which Lyes and Contradictions may be ſeen in the <hi>Skirmiſher Defeated,</hi> by <hi>W.

                     <hi>J. C.</hi> again, before he comes to give his Relation, in the third Page, ſaith, <hi>If</hi> R. H. <hi>could have been quiet, and let him alone, he had not ſaid or done any thing after the ſaid-Diſpare at</hi> Croton <hi>ended.</hi>

                     <hi>Reply,</hi> In this <hi>J. C.</hi> is a Lyar; <hi>G. F.</hi>'s words I owned, and ſaid, they did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of no ſuch conſequence, as that Man's Soul is God. But I told him, he wreſted and perverted <hi>G.

                  <p>
                     <hi>G. F.</hi> queried of the Prieſts, <hi>Is not the Soul, coming from God, Infinite?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I affirmed, the Breath of Life, which God breathed into Man, the Life and Spirit, which came forth from God, the Life of Man's Soul, or by which Man became a living Soul, was infinite;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42082:69"/>and <hi>G. F</hi>'s words, as intended, were ſound.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>J. C.</hi> affirmed, <hi>There was n othing come forth from God, which is infinite and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beginning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I replied, The Son of God came forth from God, yet the Son of God was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and without beginning; to which <hi>J. C.</hi> was ſilent.</p>
                  <p>This my Anſwer was according to Scripture, <hi>John</hi> 8.42. Jeſus ſaid, <hi>I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded forth, and came from God;</hi> this was he who ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 17.5. <hi>O Father, Glorifie thou me with thy own ſelf, with the Glory which I had with thee before the World was.</hi> Verſe 24. <hi>For thou lovedſt me before the Foundation of the World.</hi> John 16.27, 28, 30. <hi>For the Father himſelf loveth you, becauſe you have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from the Fathar, and am come into the World.</hi> Again, <hi>I leave the World, and go to the Father; by this we believe, that thou cameſt forth from God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>J. C.</hi> aſſerted, <hi>There was nothing in Man that is infinite.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I replied, The Breath of Life breathed into Man; the Spirit of God in Man, is Infinite.</p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:42082:69"/>
                  <p> This was according to Scripture, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7. <hi>And breathed into his Noſtrils the Breath of Life.</hi> 1 Cor. 3.16. <hi>Know ye not that ye are the Temple of God, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Mark, The Spirit of God was in Men, dwelt in them, ſpoke in them; ſo, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scriptures, God's Spirit, which is infinite, dwells in Man, and ſpeaks in Man; even the Spirit of Truth, which proceedeth from the Father, <hi>John</hi> 15.26.

                  <p>Now, Reader, is not <hi>J.

                  <p>I have examined <hi>J. C</hi>'s Relation. In this particular, the ſubſtance whereof is, <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>do hold Man's Soul to be God; and that they had nothing they could object, but only that</hi> Fox <hi>doth not expreſſly ſay, The Soul is</hi> God.</p>

                     <p>In this latter ſenſe, taking the Soul for that Life or Breath, by which Man lived, or became a living <hi>Soul;</hi> this, as <hi>G. F.</hi> ſaith (p. 68.) is <hi>infinite;</hi> which he muſt needs intend, as his own words do import, being taken in their own proper and gennine ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>It appears in <hi>G. F</hi>'s Controverſie with the Prieſts about the Soul, that he takes up the word <hi>Soul,</hi> and ſpeaks of it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der three Conſiderations, 1ſt, <hi>The</hi> Soul <hi>of Man</hi> in Tranſgreſſion, <hi>in Death;</hi> 2dly, <hi>The</hi> Soul <hi>of Man</hi> in the Reſtoration, <hi>in Life;</hi> and 3dly, He ſpeaks of the word <hi>Soul,</hi> as being that Breath of Life which came forth from God, by which <hi>Man Lived,</hi> or <hi>Became a Living Soul,</hi> which Breath and Life is of God's Being, and Infinite, as I ſaid before.</p>
                     <p>Thus it appears, that the Spirit of God, the Light of Chriſt within, the Breath of Life, and the <hi>Quakers</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and <hi>G. F.</hi> are all clear from <hi>J. C</hi>'s wicked Charge, and <hi>J. C.</hi> is a Lyar, whoſe Work hath been, both by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputation and Writing, to prove that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42082:74"/>the <hi>Quakers</hi> aſſert Man's Soul to be God, and ſo charge God to be guilty of Sin; becauſe Man's Soul Sins, therefore God Sins: This Wicked Blaſphemous Aſſertion and Conſequence (he would have faſtened upon the <hi>Quakers,</hi> which) we do utterly deny. But <hi>J. C.</hi> hath failed in his purpoſe, and the <hi>Quakers</hi> are clear of holding Man's Soul to he God; and <hi>J. C</hi>'s falſe Charge, <hi>That the</hi> Quakers <hi>Religion is againſt God's Spirit;</hi> remains unproved, and like to remain unproved. What <hi>J. C.</hi> hath done, is this, He hath brought one wicked Charge to prove another by, and both alike are utterly falſe: And what <hi>J. C.</hi> intended <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſtly</hi> to have faſtened upon the <hi>Quakers,</hi> is it not in a great meaſure juſtly fallen upon his own Head? For, whereas he ſays, <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>do plainly hold Man's Soul to be God,</hi> therefore when Man's Soul Sins, God Sins; is it not clearly evident, that <hi>J. C.</hi> plainly holds the Light within, the Light of Chriſt in Man, wherewith Chriſt light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every: Man that cometh into the World, <hi>John</hi> 1.9. ſomething of God in Man, Light and Spirit, to be Man's Soul, to have a hand in Sin, to be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42082:74"/>as being himſelf, and in Hell to be a felf-tormenting Light? I ſhall give ſome Quotations out of his Book, enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>Quakeriſm Subverted,</hi> and query a little thereupon, and ſo leave it to the Impartial Reader to judge. Pag. 21. of the ſaid Book, <hi>J. C.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Every Man hath a Light within him;</hi> and ſo we ſay, that Jeſus Chriſt is the true Light, which enlightneth every Man that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the World, <hi>John</hi> 1.9. P. 28. <hi>Hath not every Man a Light within him</hi> [Mark] <hi>given him to be his Guide, his Monitor?</hi> P. 27, 28. <hi>In every Man there is ſomething of God, and ſomething of Satan, Fleſh and Spirit, Light and Darkneſs,</hi> Upon which I query, If ſomething of <hi>God</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>Satan, Spirit</hi> and <hi>Light,</hi> in oppoſition to the <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> is it not the Spirit of God, who is a Spirit? <hi>John</hi> 4.24. Is it not Light of God, who is Light, and in whom is no Darkneſs at all? 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.5. <hi>J. C.</hi> ſays, it is ſomething of God, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Light, is it not then the Light and Spirit of God, according to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. Pag. 34, 35. he ſays, <hi>If the Light within never did err, nor can err, it is the ſame to ſay, the Soul
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42082:75"/>of Man never did err, nor can err:</hi> P. 35. <hi>When we ſay, The</hi> Light <hi>ſmiteth or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth, excuſeth or reproveth, it's but the ſame to ſay, The Soul doth return upon it ſelf.</hi> Upon which I query, Whether that which Convinceth and Reproveth the Soul for Sin, be not the Spirit of Truth which reproves the World of Sin? Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>John</hi> 16.8, 10. And if the Spirit of Truth, which Convinceth and Reproveth the Soul for Sin, then whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he doth not plainly hold the Spirit of Truth to be Man's <hi>Soul?</hi> Pag. 34. he ſaith, <hi>The Light hath a Hand in all Thought-ſins, inward Heart-Sins, Tongue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins, and Life-ſins.</hi> Pag. 36. <hi>Every Sin I commit, the Light within is guilty, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing myſelf.</hi> Pag. 34. <hi>The Light within in Hell is turned to a ſelf tormenting Light.</hi> Is it not clearly evident from theſe Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, out of his Book, that <hi>J. C.</hi> hath aſſerted the Light within, the Light of Chriſt in Man (wherewith, according to <hi>John</hi> 1.7. Chriſt lighteth every Man that cometh into the World) ſomething of God in Man, Light and Spirit to be Man's <hi>Soul?</hi> To have a Hand in Sin, to be himſelf guilty of Sin, and in Hell to be a ſelf-tormenting Light? And is not
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:42082:75"/>this Blaſphemy? And is not <hi>J. C.</hi> a Blaſphemer? And if <hi>J. C</hi>'s Religion hold forth and maintain this Doctrine, Is not <hi>J. C</hi>'s Religion guilty of Blaſphemy? And if <hi>J. C</hi>'s Religion be guilty of Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, Is not <hi>J. C</hi>'s Religion againſt God's Spirit? And hath not <hi>J. C</hi> made a Pit, and digged it for the <hi>Quakers</hi> and their Religion, and is not <hi>J. C.</hi> and his Religion fallen into the Ditch which he made? Let the Reader judge.</p>
                     <p>The next thing in <hi>J. C</hi>'s Relation, that here I ſhall take notice of, is in pag. 6. he ſaith, <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>do utterly make void the Scriptures; this</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was prov'd at the Diſpute.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply,</hi> Was ever any pretended Goſpel-Miniſter more void of ſhame, than is this <hi>J. C.</hi> to publiſh ſuch Lyes to the World? What's more falſe, than to aſſert, we make the <hi>Scriptures</hi> void? And, What's leſs true, than to ſay, he proved it? O wicked Man of ſlander in the one, and ſhameleſs impudent Liar in the other. I do believe I might have the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of ſome hundreds of People (who were Auditors at the ſaid Diſpute) that <hi>J. C</hi>'s Relation is falſe, if I needed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: But it may be he thinks the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42082:76"/>of a <hi>Miniſter of Chriſt,</hi> will give him Credit, where his Lyes are broached, with People, to believe what he ſays is true; eſpecially againſt <hi>R. H.</hi> by him ſtiled a <hi>Sect-Maſter:</hi> R. H. expects to fare no better from him, than the Diſciples of Chriſt did from his Generation, the <hi>Scribes, Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> who call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them peſtilent Fellows, Seducers, Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Law and Scriptures; all which <hi>J. C.</hi> is guilty of againſt the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> as the Generation he is of was againſt the Diſciples; ſo it is evident, he is in the foot-ſteps of that Generation: <hi>J. C.</hi> might have remembred, the Truth was by his fore-Fathers (in whoſe ſteps he is, reſiſting the Holy Ghoſt (Holy Spirit) as they did) called a <hi>Sect;</hi> and no doubt but the Apoſtles were account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Sect-Maſters</hi> by <hi>J. C.</hi>'s Predeceſſors, as well as <hi>R. H.</hi> is ſtilled a <hi>Sect-Maſter</hi> by him; for the Truth's ſake (which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpers and prevails) <hi>R. H.</hi> can bear it; and <hi>J. C.</hi> hath diſcovered Himſelf, and manifeſted his Folly: But perhaps he thinks, whatever he ſays or writes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Slander, Lye or Scoff, his Coat will bear him out; but if ſo, his thoughts will deceive him; for there are many
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:42082:76"/>will not ſo take things upon truſt, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from him, nor any of his Brethren, either becauſe of their <hi>Black Coat,</hi> or <hi>White Coat,</hi> but him will reprehend and judge for his Slanders, Lyes and Scoffing. Sure I may ſay, a lying ſpirit hath entered him, and acts him (and it is againſt that ſpirit my controverſie is, I have Love and Good will to the Creature) for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were that day owned by us, in their place, as they have ever been by us ſince we were a People to God's Praiſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>J. C.</hi> had Will enough to have proved all he hath ſaid, but he wanted Power; Truth being ſtronger than all: Neither had he ſo much Skill as Baſeneſs, nor Honeſty as Impudence. He laboured by indirect means to accompliſh his wicked End; but fell ſhort, and inſtead of <hi>Glory,</hi> reaped <hi>Shame.</hi> And why may I not uſe his own Expreſſion, publiſhed to the World (only inſtead of the word <hi>Foes,</hi> put in <hi>Opponent</hi>) and ſay, <hi>In this</hi> J. C. <hi>came poorly off, as when he prayed, his Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent being too hard for him?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There were ſeveral that Day (his Baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Wickedneſs being diſcovered, and laid open) cried againſt him; and one called aloud unto him, and openly
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:42082:77"/>aſſerted, <hi>J. C.</hi> to be a <hi>Lyar,</hi> and offered to prove it to his Face, and ſaid, <hi>He was No Quaker.</hi> But when <hi>J. C.</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the <hi>Baptiſt</hi>'s Book, which he would have made the People to have believed, was one of our Books, out of which he brought a Quotation; I asked to ſee the Book, he refuſed; I preſſed again to ſee it, not ſo much queſtioning the Book, as that he had wronged the words in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; he again refuſed: I promiſed, if he would let me have our Friend's Bood, to read the Quotation my ſelf, I would do the like for him, with any Book I produced, if requeſted; when he ſaw I would not be ſatisfied, but preſſed ſtill to ſee the Book, then he confeſſed, <hi>It was the Baptiſts Book,</hi> and impudently aſſerted the Quotation was <hi>right,</hi> and that <hi>they had truly ſtated our Friends Aſſertion.</hi> But his diſ-ingenuity thereby appear'd, he being laid open, and many ſaw him baffled in his Undertaking. He alſo gave other Forged Quotations, which he would have had the People believe were our Friends Aſſertions; yet all would not avail, to prove the <hi>Quakers</hi> Religion was againſt the Scriptures. A Second Branch of the afore-cited Charge, which, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:42082:77"/>to prove, he aſſerted, That the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers made the Scriptures uſeleſs, and utterly void;</hi> alledging, <hi>That if the Scriptures were not the Rule of Faith, they were uſeleſs, and utterly void;</hi> quoting the Second of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> 3.16.</p>
                     <p>To which I replied, I deny the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> do make void the Scriptures; but that they own them, I affirm; and that they are profitable to the Man of god: But there is no Man of God, without God's Spirit; it is the Spirit of God that makes a Man of God; and it is the Spirit of God, which was the Rule to the Man of God, before the Scriptures were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; and that which was the Rule to the <hi>Man of God,</hi> is the Rule to the <hi>Man of God;</hi> that which gives Faith, is the Rule of Faith; and that is the Spirit of God which gave Faith, and was the Rule of Faith, before the Scriptures were written: Yet this makes not the Scriptures uſeleſs; for the <hi>Man of God,</hi> who walks according to this Rule, the <hi>Spirit,</hi> lives the Life the Scriptures declare of: And to ſuch a Man the Scriptures are profitable; though he cannot ſet the Scriptures above the Spirit, which gave them forth; yet owning them in their place, hath a more real eſteem
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:42082:78"/>for the Scriptures, than that Man who cries them up for his Rule, yet walks contrary thereunto, and ſhort of the Life the Scriptures teſtifie of.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>John Cheyney</hi> ſaith, in the ſame Page, R. H. <hi>would not ſay, that the Scriptures were no Rule at all—But he affirmed, that they were not the Rule.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply,</hi> This grant of <hi>J. C</hi>'s proveth, I did not make the Scriptures uſeleſs and void. I aſſerted, as before, That the Spirit is the Rule of Doctrinal Saving Faith; for that which is more univerſal than the Scriptures, which was the Rule of Faith before and ever ſince the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were written (to wit) of ſaving Faith, is the Spirit which gave Faith, and ruled it, and gives Faith, and rules it; for, what it was, it is; and what it is, it will for ever remain, becauſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable. And I further add, That that which the Saints walked in, was their Rule; and that was the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Walk in the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. Yet is not the Scriptures made void, but fulfilled: This is but a falſe Suggeſtion of <hi>J. C.</hi> That <hi>Scriptures are either the Rule, or uſeleſs;</hi> for he that walks in <hi>Spirit,</hi> comes in meaſure to know the <hi>Scriptures</hi> ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</p>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:42082:78"/>
                     <p> It is the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> which gives ſaving Knowledge; and that which gives ſaving Knowledge, is the ſaving Rule; One to all God's People, throughout all Ages of the World, ſince <hi>Adam</hi> was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; his Rule before he fell, his Rule as he came up again in the ſame Life from which he fell; <hi>Enoch</hi>'s Rule, in which he walked with God, before the <hi>Scriptures</hi> were written; the <hi>Prophets</hi> Rule, who ſpake forth <hi>Scriptures</hi> by God's Spirit, who were Prophets before the Scriptures they ſpoke forth (by God's Spirit) were written; the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> Rule, who ſet forth a Declaration of thoſe things which were moſt ſurely believed amongſt them, having had perfect underſtanding of all things from the very firſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.1, 3. Mark, they had perfect underſtanding of all things they writ, before they writ them; the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Rule, who were Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles before their Epiſtles were written; the Rule of all the <hi>Holy Men of God</hi> ſince the Apoſtles days; for there is no Holy Man of God, without God's Spirit: <hi>He that hath not the Spirit of God, is none of his,</hi> Rom. 8.9. <hi>He that hath the Spirit, is to walk in it,</hi> Gal. 5.16, 25. He that walks in the Spirit, it is his Rule; he
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42082:79"/>asketh Counſel of God, as by <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> hath an anſwer from God, takes Counſel of God, and is covered with a Covering of God's Spirit; ſuch have comfort in reading the Scriptures, being come in meaſure to the fulfilling of them, in meaſure witneſſing what their Elder Brethren, the Prophets and Apoſtles, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared of their Experiences, as they did tread in their Foot-ſteps; for One is the Way for the Righteous in all Ages, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Way, the Truth, and the Life,</hi> John 14.6. <hi>No Man comes to the Father but by him.</hi> In the ſame Way, and by the ſame Rule, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Spirit,</hi> in and by which they walked, who had not the Scriptures, walked they who gave forth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; not only before they gave forth the Scriptures, but afterwards, in the ſame Way, and by the ſame Rule have they walked, do, and ſhall they walk, who have come, do, or ſhall come to live the Life the <hi>Scriptures</hi> declare of; and not one of theſe, who lives the Life the Scriptures teſtifie of, make the Scriptures void, as <hi>J. C.</hi> falſly ſuggeſteth; who thereby hath manifeſted his Ignorance, both of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and of the <hi>Power of God;</hi> being one of thoſe unlearned,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:42082:79"/>who wreſts the <hi>Scriptures to their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.16.</p>
                     <p>And for his ſaying, <hi>The Scriptures were proved the Rule;</hi> it is falſe: For the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> was proved the Rule, and yet the <hi>Scriptures</hi> not made void.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>J. C.</hi> in page 10, 11. to prove <hi>W. P.</hi> and <hi>R.

There is the ſame Law and Rule to wicked Men as to godly Men; the ſame Scripture which breeds Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical Faith, breedeth Saving Faith; but neither one nor the other without the Spirit of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply,</hi> Now if this Tale he true, that Hiſtorical Faith and Saving Faith are not two Faiths, nor oppoſite, but one Faith; and that upon this point, Down muſt go the whole Body of <hi>Quakeriſm:</hi> Then I argue thus,</p>
                     <p>He that hath Hiſtorical Faith, hath Saving Faith, if they be one, as <hi>J. C.</hi> ſays they are, and not oppoſite; then
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42082:80"/>there is no difference betwixt a Dead Faith, and a Living Faith; a Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Works, and a Faith that hath Works: <hi>J. C.</hi> ſaith, <hi>They are not two, nor oppoſite; where-ever,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>there is Saving Faith, there is Hiſtorical; and the Rule is one and the ſame</hi> (Is it not as broad as long?) where-ever then there is Hiſtorical Faith, there is Saving Faith; for, ſaith <hi>J. C. They are not two Faiths, nor oppoſite, but one Faith; and the Rule is one and the ſame.</hi> But doth not this contradict the Scripture, and give the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> the Lye? Who ſaith, <hi>Thou believeſt that there is one God, thou doſt well; the Devils alſo believe and tremble. But wilt thou know, O vain Man, that Faith without Works is dead,</hi> James 2.19, 20. What ſaith <hi>J. C? Hiſtorical Faith, and Saving Faith, are not two Faiths, nor oppoſite, but one Faith.</hi> What is this but to ſay, the Faith of vain and wicked Men, and the Belief of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and the Faith of God's Elect, are not oppoſite, not two Faiths, but one Faith? <hi>J. C</hi>'s aſſertion plainly holds forth this Doctrine, That there is no difference nor oppoſition between Hiſtorical Faith, and Saving Faith; Faith without Works, and Faith which hath Works; Dead
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:42082:80"/>Faith, and living Faith; the Faith of Wicked Men, and the Faith of God's Elect.</p>
                     <p>I will not ſay <hi>J. C.</hi> is a Ranter in Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice: But let the Reader judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>J. C.</hi> be not a Ranter in Principle: For, <hi>J. C.</hi> cannot deny but that Devils, and wicked Men, believe there is a <hi>God,</hi> and that the belief of Devils, and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men, is not ſaving; and that wicked Men, whoſe Faith is not ſaving, but vain, believe the Hiſtory of the Scriptures. Now, whether the hiſtorical Faith of vain and wicked Men, and the ſaving Faith of God's Elect, be not oppoſite, be not two Faiths, but one entire ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith, let Truth in all People judge.</p>
                     <p>Likewiſe, obſerve how groſly <hi>J. C.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts himſelf; for he ſays, <hi>Neither the one nor the other doth the Scriptures breed without the Spirit of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If they be one and another, they are two; if they be two, <hi>J. C.</hi> gives himſelf the Lye, who before ſaid, <hi>They were not two, but one;</hi> and he makes God's Spirit the Author of them both: And again he ſaith, <hi>The Spirit in both concurreth, and maketh uſe of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;</hi>
                        <pb n="90" facs="tcp:42082:81"/>in this he concludes them to be two; for <hi>J. C.</hi> ſaith, <hi>In both,</hi> that is, in both Faiths, Hiſtorical and Saving. Again <hi>J. C.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Saving and Hiſtorical Faith are not two Faiths, are not oppoſite.</hi> Now the Verb <hi>(are)</hi> is plural, and ſpeaks of more then one: So all along though <hi>J. C.</hi> deny them to be two, he concludes them to be two Faiths, and wofully contradicts himſelf; and inſtead of throwing down the whole Body of <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> is ſadly confounded: Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Faith is one thing; the Drunkard, Lyar, Whoremonger, Deceiver, may have it; or he that hath made ſhipwrack of that Faith which is ſaving, and of a good Conſcience, may yet have hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Faith; that is, he may acknowledge there is a God: But <hi>Saving Faith</hi> is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing; this Faith all Men have not, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.2. but God viſits all with his Spirit and Power, in order to give ſaving Faith; but many reſiſt the Viſitation of God, and periſh in their Gain ſaying; the Deſtruction of all ſuch is of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the Lord God is Clear. Of hiſtorical Faith, the Hiſtory may be a Rule; but of ſaving Faith, the Myſtery is a Rule: The Spirit gives ſaving

                     <p>The People called <hi>Quakers</hi> do prefer and eſteem the Book called the <hi>Bible,</hi> or Holy Scriptures, above any outward Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or Book extant upon the Earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Verity and Plenty of deep heavenly Sayings, uttered by God unto <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, through the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Ages of the World; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly and eminently through the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Man, Chriſt Jeſus, who was anointed with the Oyl of Gladneſs, above his Fellows, and filled with the Spirit without meaſure. Nevertheleſs, we do affirm, that the Spirit of God in this Age, hath moved ſeveral of us to write Books, which have been Inſtrumental in his Hand for Good unto many, with reſpect to their Immortal Souls. God the Holy One changeth not, neither is he to be limited; and all our Books and Writings are not of equal Authority one
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:42082:83"/>with another; ſome treat of our inward Experience of the Work of God, in which are contained words that do direct Man and Woman to the Manifeſtation of the Spirit of God, which is given them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit withal; to the Grace of God, which brings Salvation; to the Light, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Chriſt lighteth every one that comes into the World. Some others of our Books do treat of our Sufferings, and outward Exerciſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which though all of them be true, yet ſome are of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er weight than others. And Deſtruction comes upon People becauſe they do not believe in and obey the Light, Grace and Spirit of God, which he hath given them, to lead them out of Sin, into all Truth. Thoſe who read our Writings without Prejudice, may receive Good thereby, as by Inſtruments which God makes uſe of; and ſuch who do ſo, they will return the Glory to God, as we do: And thoſe who read our Books in Envy and Malice, the Murdering Spirit blinds their Minds, and God doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn ſuch.</p>

For in the Scriptures there are words of the <hi>Serpent,</hi> who is called the <hi>Devil</hi> and <hi>Satan;</hi> words of wicked Men, as well as God's words, and words of good Men: And hath not <hi>J.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply, J. C.</hi> himſelf grants the word [<hi>is</hi>] not to be expreſſed in the Original Text; but that the Original Text is read thus, <hi>All Scripture given by Inſpiration of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:42082:84"/>God,</hi> &amp;c. the word <hi>(is)</hi> not being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; why then ſhould <hi>R. H.</hi> be blamed for reading it according to the Original Text, which was before the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Copy or Tranſlation? Yet there is extant ſome old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bibles, in which this Scripture is thus read, <hi>All Scripture given by Inſpiration of God, is profitable,</hi> &amp;c. And the word <hi>(is)</hi> and alſo the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction <hi>(and)</hi> about which <hi>J. C.</hi> quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels ſo much, are left out. But it ſeems <hi>J. C.</hi> will rather skirmiſh with his own Shadow, than have nothing to do: For, what he grants to be true, <hi>R. H.</hi> muſt, if he can reach it, be ſtigmatized, as ſome Blaſphemer. But this way of skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhing will never hurt <hi>R. H.</hi> nor ſtain his Reputation amongſt good Men. <hi>R. H.</hi> acknowledged, and doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, All <hi>Scripture</hi> given by Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, to be profitable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But <hi>J. C.</hi> is Angry with him, becauſe he will not ſay, All Scripture is given by Inſpiration of God, though he grants the word <hi>(is)</hi> not to be expreſſed in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Text; therefore <hi>R. H</hi>'s Reading is true.</p>
                     <p>And that all <hi>Scripture,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, All Writing, is given by
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:42082:85"/>Inſpiration of God; I think <hi>J. C.</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, If conſiderate, will not aſſert; for <hi>All Writing</hi> contains or comprehends every Writing that is written; not only in the Scriptures of Truth, the Books of the Prophets, Evangeliſts, the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles, and other Writings of Truth extant; but all other Writings extant, of what matter or ſubject ſoever they treat. If <hi>J. Chayney</hi> grants this, that all Writing, <hi>viz.</hi> all Books, of what nature or kind ſoever, that are written, printed and publiſhed to the World, are not given by Inſpiration of God, as ſure he will; then he grants, all Scripture is not given by Inſpiration of God; for, <hi>All Scripture,</hi> comprehends all Writing; and all Writing, includes all Books, that are written; and all Books that are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, are not profitable to the Man of God for Doctrine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then he muſt needs grant the Apoſtles Meaning was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Original Text; with which the old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bibles agree, (to wit) All Scripture given by Inſpiration of God, is profitable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This ſenſe the Original Text will bear, without any wrong to the Truth, or the Apoſtle who ſpoke it forth: To this the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> alludes,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:42082:85"/>2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20, 21. <hi>No Propheſie of the Scripture is of any private Interpretation;</hi> (Mark) <hi>for the Propheſie came not in old time by the will of Man, but holy Men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> The Apoſtle here ſpeaks of the Propheſies of the Scripture, what was ſpoken in the Motion of the Holy Ghoſt: Now that all that was ſpoken, and is written in the Bible, was ſpoken in the Motion of the Holy Ghoſt (there being ſomething ſpoken by wicked Men in the Bible, which was my aſſertion) <hi>J. C.</hi> doth not affirm. But <hi>J. C.</hi> will have it, <hi>That every word in the whole Bible was given by the Inſpiration of God, to the Holy Pen-Men, who were inſpired to write them.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply,</hi> This alters the ſtate of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie betwixt us, which was about ſpeaking forth what afterwards was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> what the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and wicked Men ſpoke, who called Chriſt <hi>Beelzebub, a Samaritan,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>He had a Devil,</hi> &amp;c. It was not the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Relation that we were about; but of its being ſpoken before Recorded, we were arguing: I ſaid, The Serpent, the Devil, and wicked Men ſpoke words which are recorded in Scriptures, and none of them
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:42082:86"/>ſpoke thoſe words in the Motion of God's Spirit.</p>
                     <p>But though it be a little beſide the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I query, How <hi>J. C.</hi> will prove (yet I deny not that the holy Pen Men of Scriptures had God's Spirit, and were aſſiſted by it in the recording the words of wicked Men) that every Pen-Man that writ of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> writ not a word but what was opened in him by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of God, which he neither heard of Man, nor received from Man, but in the Immediate Revelation of God received it, and by Inſpiration writ it? Or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome of the Pen-Men ſaw not with their outward Eyes ſeveral things which they writ of, and heard not with their outward Ears ſeveral words which are written in the Scripture, which they heard of Men? According to <hi>Luke</hi> 1.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.1. &amp; 23.16, to 23.1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. 11. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.11, &amp;c. <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.29. &amp; 45.9, to 28. <hi>Judges</hi> 16.17, 18. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.5, to 17. &amp; 18.10, &amp;c. <hi>Eſther</hi> 4.</p>

                        <hi>J. C.</hi> in page 21. ſaith, <hi>R. H. in the Diſpute, did openly affirm, That God did no where command us to walk according to the Scriptures, and the Laws and Doctrines of the Scriptures; but all are to walk in the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:42082:86"/>Spirit, and after the Spirit, and according to the Spirit; wickedly oppoſing the Spirit, and his Holy Laws: He was quickly ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply,</hi> In this I may truly ſay, <hi>John Cheyney</hi> hath far exceeded, not only the bounds of Truth, but Honeſty, in forg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lyes, and publiſhing a falſe Accuſation and Slander againſt me, to render me odious in the ſight of good Men: But ſure I am, notwithſtanding <hi>J. C</hi>'s wicked Lyes, falſe Accuſation and Slander (which I hope will find no more acceptance with good Men, than his Hypocritical Praying, Diſſembling and Lying, hath with God, as in his <hi>Prayer-Book,</hi> p. 141.) that I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſaid, neither ever ſo intended: For, <hi>firſt,</hi> it is againſt my Principle; the Spirit of Truth leads into all Truth, ſuch who ſtand in the counſel of it, and are freely given up to be led by it: This Spirit is in the inward parts, and that is ſome-where; and God by it, in our inward parts, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to walk Holily, Righteouſly and Godlily in this World; to obſerve his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and keep his Commandments; love God above all things, and our Neighbours as our ſelves; and to do to all Men as we would they ſhould do to us; this is the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:42082:87"/>Law and the Prophets; and to own the Precepts, Doctrines, Laws and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, contained in the Scriptures; and fully to believe, That God, who by his Spirit gave them forth through his Prophets, commanded that People ſhould keep them, and walk in his fear, and be Witneſſes of the fulfilling of them, and walk and live in that Holy Life the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures declare of; and this walking is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scriptures. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is contrary to my Practice: But, leſt <hi>J. C.</hi> or any other, if I ſhould ſpeak what I might ſpeak in the Truth, concerning it, ſhould judge me to boaſt concerning my Practice; I ſhall ſay thus much, It is ſuch as in meaſure becomes the Goſpel, fearing God, eſchewing Evil; and this is according to <hi>Scripture.</hi> And for my <hi>Converſation</hi> in the World, to them who know me, and know it alſo, I ſhall leave it, for them to ſpeak further thereof, as they find cauſe; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not in meaſure according to the Converſation of thoſe, who in times paſt <hi>walked not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8.1. I did, and I do aſſert, (as before) That the Spirit of God is the Rule of Saving Faith; and that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did not direct People to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42082:87"/>to be the Rule of Saving Faith; or ſay, <hi>Walk in the Scriptures, they are the Rule:</hi> For, although the Apoſtle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the Noble <hi>Bereans</hi> for ſearching the Scriptures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo did he for receiving the Word with diligence; but he did not direct the <hi>Bereans</hi> to the Scriptures, to be the Rule of Saving Faith: But the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> directed People to the <hi>ſure Word of Propheſie, which was nigh in the Heart,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.19. Rom. 10.8. <hi>And turned them from Darkneſs to Light, from Satan's Power, to the Power of God,</hi> Acts 26.18. <hi>To the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction of the Holy One, the Anointing within, which teacheth all things,</hi> 1 John 2.27. <hi>To the Spirit, thereby to mortifie the Deeds of the Body, that they might live,</hi> Rom. 8.13. <hi>To walk in the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 4.16. <hi>Walk in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and ye ſhall not fulfil the Luſts of the Fleſh:</hi> I ſay, becauſe I thus aſſerted, and alſo proved the <hi>Spirit</hi> to be the Rule of Saving Faith, and not the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> and the Apoſtles directed to the <hi>Spirit</hi> for the Rule, and not to the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be the Rule; and that they did not ſay, <hi>Walk in the Scriptures, they are the Rule;</hi> but, <hi>Walk in the Spirit:</hi> I ſay, becauſe I did prefer the <hi>Spirit</hi> to be the Rule of Faith,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:42082:88"/>before the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> yet owned the <hi>Scriptures in their place:</hi> Therefore <hi>J.

                     <p>And for his ſaying, We <hi>wickedly oppoſe the Spirit, and his Holy Laws.</hi>

                     <p>I ſay, He wickedly Belyes and Slanders us; for we own the <hi>Spirit</hi> in its place, and the <hi>Scriptures</hi> in their place, not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them.</p>

                     <p>But <hi>J. C.</hi> relates the Argument, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he proved (as he vainly imagines) the Charge againſt us, in that we are <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, and Turn-coats from the true Faith.</hi> This is his Argument.</p>

                        <hi>Reply,</hi> That we are <hi>Apoſtates, and Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coats from the true Faith,</hi> is a Charge as falſe as the other, which he intended this to have been an Argument to prove; and this hath been <hi>J.

The true Faith is the Gift of God, this we are not turned from; it is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto us, as it was delivered unto the <hi>Saints;</hi> it was their Victory, and is our Victory, even our Faith; our Faith ſtands in God's Power, we live by it; <hi>The Juſt ſhall live by Faith,</hi> Hab. 2.4. This is the true Faith, by which the Juſt lives; we are turned from ſuch as have not the One Faith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.5. For all <hi>Men have not Faith,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 3.2. And from ſuch who having in ſome things the Form of Godlineſs, but deny the Power thereof, according as the Apoſtle exhorted ſome in his day, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. And we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Lord in ſo doing. So that <hi>J.

                     <p>But <hi>J. C.</hi> ſays, <hi>He did with ſober com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate Zeal, and a warm affected Heart,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:42082:89"/>make Challenge to</hi> R. H. <hi>to give any one Reaſon for their Apoſtacy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply,</hi> Sober Compaſſionate Zeal, <hi>&amp;c. J. C.</hi> might well have omitted to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who rather appeared ſometimes that day like a Stage-Player, than a ſober Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putant: I might ſay, like one acting the Fool's part in a Play, at times, he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther behaved himſelf, than like a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Man; ſuch words as theſe (in an airy ſpirit) he vented forth, <hi>I'll be with thee anon: Thou hadſt better have kept that word in: Thou haſt now put a Weapon into my Hand I never thought of;</hi> with theſe, and the like Expreſſions, ſtirring up ſome People to Laughter, and putting them into an Expectation, he would do ſome great Matter: But alas! Their fooliſh vain Hopes, with his fond Conceit, were both fruſtrated; for when he had room to ſpeak, he acted but like a Fool, with his wooden Sword, made a Vapour, but effected nothing, ſave Shame to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Now, as to his Challenging me, <hi>to give any one Reaſon for our Apoſtacy:</hi> I anſwer, No wiſe Man can expect that I ſhould give any one Reaſon for our <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy,</hi> who are not Apoſtatized, but have
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:42082:90"/>the Evidence of <hi>God's Spirit,</hi> that we have the Faith delivered unto us, that was delivered unto the <hi>Saints;</hi> for that were to give a Reaſon for what we are not: Nay, I am perſwaded, none but a Novice, or a Fool, would require it. But this is not the firſt Diſtraction, beſides his being <hi>Diſtracted in Prayer, J. C.</hi> hath run into.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>J. C.</hi> ſaith, <hi>R. H could give no Reaſon at all, nor had any mind to argue it, but ſhifted it off, That the</hi> Quakers <hi>Religion, Miniſtry, Worſhip and Churches, were oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to theirs.</hi> And if his Reader will take his word for it, he ſaith, He <hi>hath given</hi> R. H. <hi>and his Fellows, an Argument at</hi> Croton, <hi>which could not be anſwered or gainſaid by any of them then, nor can they ever anſwer it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply,</hi> That the <hi>Quakers</hi> Religion, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, Worſhip and Church, are oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to <hi>J. C</hi>'s Religion, Miniſtry, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Church, <hi>J. C.</hi> hath aſſerted; and if he do believe it, what needs fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proof? But would not <hi>J. C.</hi> have been ſhifting from the Charge, and broaching new Matter? He would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times have been begging the Queſtion, to have wreſted me from the Charge; but keeping him to the Point, not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:42082:90"/>him leave to Catechiſe me, having put him upon the Proof of his Charge, I kept him to it, not ſuffering him to ſtart new Arguments to lead from it, he failed in Proof, and came off with Infamy.</p>
                     <p>As to the Argument at <hi>Croton,</hi> it was there gain-ſaid and anſwered (therefore <hi>J. C.</hi> is a Lyar, who ſaid, <hi>It could not be anſwered or gain-ſaid</hi>) the Invalidity of which Argument may be ſeen in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of this Treatiſe, where I have run it through.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>J. C.</hi> ſaith, <hi>He repeated the ſame Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at</hi> Arley-<hi>Diſpute, but that I declined the Arguing of it, and was utterly unable to maintain my own Religion, and to take off the Charge, That the</hi> Quakers <hi>are Belly-gods and Fleſh-ſervers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply,</hi> I declined not the Argument for the Validity of it, but becauſe it led from the Charge <hi>J. C.</hi> had undertaken to prove, <hi>viz. That the</hi> Quakers <hi>were Belly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gods,</hi> &amp;c. And it being gain ſaid and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered already, I ſhall paſs it by, only note to the Reader, that <hi>J. C.</hi> ſaid at <hi>Croton, You own'd the Doctrine which was according to the Ten Commandments, Lord's Prayer, and Creed.</hi> To which I replied, <hi>The Doctrine of the Commandments, which
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:42082:91"/>is, To love God with all the Heart, with all the Soul, Might and Strength, is owned by us; and the Doctrine of the Lord's Prayer; which is, That the Will of God may be done in Earth, as it is in Heaven, we alſo own. But that you, who preach this for Doctrine, live up to it, we deny; and therefore are turned from you. And as to the Creed, we believe in God and in Chriſt.</hi> To this <hi>J. C.</hi> replied not.</p>
                     <p>I ſuppoſe, that in all his Notes, he had nothing writ in Defence of his Cauſe in this point; and perhaps being accuſtomed to lean upon his Crutch, he would not venture to go without it: But however it was, whether he would not, or could not, I ſhall leave it with the Impartial Reader to judge: Yet ſure I am, his Silence was ſo far a Conſent to my Aſſertion, that all unbiaſſed Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers could do no leſs than conclude, he wanted a Reply thereunto.</p>
                     <p>And his Charge that <hi>Quakers are Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley Gods and Fleſh-ſervers,</hi> is a falſe impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Charge; no further either at the Diſpute, or by his Relation of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute, proved, than to ſay, <hi>They are ſo:</hi> Or, that the <hi>Quakers are what they are not,</hi> in order to prove them ſo; which is no
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:42082:91"/>proof at all; yet ſo would he prove one falſe Charge by another. The <hi>Quakers</hi> were cleared from it at the Diſpute, and before and ſince the <hi>Quakers</hi> were and are clear of it, and <hi>J. C.</hi> the Lyar, who falfly accuſed, belyed and ſlandered them; and our Religion was maintained againſt all his falſe Charges, for the clearing whereof I did appear by Diſputation; and the Lord bleſſed my Undertaking, to him alone be the Praiſe. And for the Truth's ſake, and right Information of the ſimple-hearted, I do appear again in the Examination of <hi>J. C</hi>'s Relation of the Diſpute, and ſhall leave the event to the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Further, <hi>J. C.</hi> ſaith, pag. 19. Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Eccles, <hi>an audacious</hi> Quaker, <hi>a day or two after the Diſpute, ſent me a bold Challenge, by Authority from God, to Faſt with him five Days and five Nights, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Meat, Drink, and Sleep,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But the</hi> Quakers <hi>have no other Way to evade my Arguments, being rationally and unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably proved, to be ſuch as</hi> Paul <hi>deſcribes,</hi> Rom. 16.17. <hi>making their Belly their God; deviſed this Shift for a cover of their Nakedneſs and Hypocriſie.—If People will</hi>
                        <pb n="112" facs="tcp:42082:92"/>
                        <hi>venture their Souls with ſuch Cheats and Impoſtures, let them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply,</hi> That <hi>Solomon Eccles</hi> did Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge <hi>J. C.</hi> (who had charged the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> with <hi>making their Belly their God,</hi> and aſſerted, that <hi>their Belly was their God</hi>) to Faſt with him five Days and five Nights, not to Eat, not to Drink, nor to Sleep, till the five Days and Nights were faithfully performed before the Lord, for a Tryal of <hi>J. C</hi>'s Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether his Faith was in God and Chriſt, yea or nay; and whether <hi>J. C</hi>'s God, whoſe work he had done in charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Quakers</hi> to be <hi>Belly-gods,</hi> &amp;c. or the <hi>Quakers</hi> God, was the true God; and whether of them was a Member of the true Church: I having ſeen a Copy of a Paper of <hi>Solomon Eccles</hi> to this effect, do believe it is true; and I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that <hi>S. E.</hi> did not give forth this Challenge as a vain <hi>Scribe,</hi> but as one having <hi>Authority;</hi> and that the God of Heaven (if <hi>J. C.</hi> had accepted of the Challenge, and come upon Trial with him) would have ſtrengthned him to have performed it faithfully before the Lord, to the manifeſting of <hi>J. C.</hi> to be a Lyar, his Charge againſt the <hi>Quakers</hi>
                        <pb n="113" facs="tcp:42082:92"/>to be utterly falſe, and the <hi>Quakers God</hi> to be the <hi>true God;</hi> that as by Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation God appeared with us, to clear us from this, and the reſt of <hi>J. C</hi>'s wicked Charges againſt us, and manifeſt <hi>J. C.</hi> to be a Lyar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo by the Trial of <hi>J. C</hi>'s Belly, God would have appeared on our ſide, for to have made <hi>J. C.</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manifeſt to be a Lyar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if <hi>J. C.</hi> refuſed to truſt his God with his Belly, this is not a true Character that his Faith is in the True God and Chriſt; and if his Faith be not in the true God and Chriſt, he is no Member of the true Church.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>J. C.</hi> in refuſing to Faſt with <hi>S. E.</hi> for the Trial of his Faith, and of his God, hath come behind the Prophets of <hi>Baal,</hi> who embraced the Offer that <hi>Elijah</hi> the Prophet of the Lord made, and came upon the Trial of their God, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.21, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if <hi>J. C.</hi> did believe that <hi>S. E.</hi> had no Authority from God concerning that matter, Why then did not he prove <hi>S. E.</hi> and manifeſt him upon Trial? That ſure was too hard a Way for <hi>J. C.</hi> to go, becauſe his Crutch, <hi>viz.</hi> his Notes, would have done him little ſervice in that Exerciſe:
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:42082:93"/>And may I not conclude that <hi>J. C</hi>'s Faith failed him in that way of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al?</p>
                     <p>But yet <hi>J. C.</hi> would lay all at the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> Door, as that they <hi>deviſed this for a Cover of their Nakedneſs and Hypocriſie, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>no other way to evade his Arguments, being rationally and unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably proved to be ſuch as</hi> Paul <hi>deſcribes, making their Belly their God.</hi> To which I ſay, <hi>J. C</hi>'s Diſingenuity doth much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in this matter: Truth needs no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed Shifts for a Cover; it can appear with open Face: The <hi>Quakers</hi> (as I ſaid before) were cleared from this wicked Charge, and <hi>J. C</hi>'s Nakedneſs was laid open, and his Hypocriſie made manifeſt at the Diſpute, as hereafter I ſhall make appear. But is not this a deviſed Shift of <hi>J. C</hi>'s, to Cover his Nakedneſs and Hypocriſie withal, who was proved a Lyar and Deceiver at the Diſpute? Yet would he perſwade his Reader, <hi>That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a</hi> Quaker <hi>challenged to Faſt with him</hi> (for the Trial of his Faith, and of his God, that it might appear by Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) (as well as that it had been made manifeſt by Words, <hi>viz.</hi> by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputation, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> did not make
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:42082:93"/>their <hi>Belly</hi> their <hi>God,</hi> but were clear of <hi>J. C</hi>'s wicked Charge, and he made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, <hi>&amp;c.) therefore againſt the</hi> Quakers <hi>it was rationally and unanſwerably proved at the Diſpute</hi> (ſaith <hi>J. C.) that they make their Belly their God.</hi> If <hi>J. C.</hi> hath devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this for a Cover for himſelf, it is too narrow; for there are ſome Hundreds not called <hi>Quakers,</hi> who were at the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute, who notwithſtanding this Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, will ſee his Nakedneſs. But no doubt <hi>J. C.</hi> would have all to believe, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> were unanſwerably pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be ſuch as make their Belly their God; which is both a groſs Lye, and wicked Slander; yet out of his Study, <hi>J. C.</hi> hath thus ſounded and publiſhed it to the World. But what will that Man ſtick to ſay, who links his Heart with Satan? For in pag. 158. of his <hi>Sermons of Hypocriſie,</hi> J. C. ſaith, <hi>It is much eaſier to Confute a</hi> Quaker, <hi>than to Confute</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan <hi>and</hi> My own Heart. Hath not <hi>J. C.</hi> linked his own Heart with Satan? Sure ſuch who have Eyes to ſee with, may ſee him, if wilfully they do not ſhut their Eyes rather than they will ſee him; and ſuch as do ſee him, and yet will follow ſuch a Hypocrite (I ſhall forbear to call
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42082:94"/>him Cheat and Impoſtor, how deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoever he may be thereof, though he hath called us Cheats and Impoſtors very undeſervedly) and venture their Souls with him, and believe his Lyes, Slanders, and Impious Charges, againſt the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple called <hi>Quakers,</hi> rather than the Truth; I ſhall not ſay as <hi>J. C.</hi> doth, <hi>Let them:</hi> But earneſtly deſire that they may Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, Repent and Live, and alſo walk in the Light; which if they do, Peace will be upon them: But if they do not, I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving put Pen to Paper rightly to inform them (tho' their Sin be upon their own Heads) I ſhall be clear.</p>
                     <p>I have hitherto examined what <hi>J. C.</hi> hath related concerning the Proof of his Charges againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how many of the ſeven Charges, in his recited Paper of Charge, he aſſayed to prove, which were only two; the other five he makes no mention of in his Relation, neither at that time would he aſſay the Proof thereof, though he had promiſed to prove every one of them: But he vainly ſuppoſing my Charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, <hi>viz. That he was a Lyar and a Deceiver,</hi> could not be proved, he was
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42082:94"/>very urgent with me to prove my Charge againſt him, and vehemently called out for proof thereof, and would not aſſay further to prove the remaining part of his Charges, before I had proved my Charge: I hearing this, the Zeal of the Lord being upon me, it was in my Heart forthwith to prove my Charge againſt him; which I did to the full, as in the further Examination of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining part of his Relation, I ſhall clearly manifeſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>J. C.</hi> in pag. 16 ſaith, <hi>All that ever he had to ſay was from a Paſſage or two in my Book of</hi> Quakeriſm Subverted, <hi>and a few words in my Book of</hi> Prayer, pag. 141.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply,</hi> This is a notorious Lye, and he that publiſheth it is a notorious Lyar; for before I had produced either of his Books, we had diſcourſed ſome Hours, and gone through what I have already examined of the Diſpute; in which no Man of Candor can poſſibly judge, but that I ſpoke ſomething in Defence of the Truth, the <hi>Quakers</hi> and their Religion, in order to clear them, and prove <hi>J. C.</hi> a Lyar. <hi>J. C.</hi> himſelf, in Contradiction
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42082:95"/>to himſelf, in his Relation, confeſſeth I ſaid ſomething, and ſomething of what I ſaid he hath written, which gives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Lye; and likewiſe ſomething that he ſaith I ſaid, which I am ſure I never ſpoke, as I have cleared before; all which was before his Books were brought forth: And yet he is not aſhamed to ſay, <hi>All that ever I had to ſay, was from ſome Paſſages in his Books.</hi> Sure if a Catalogue of this Man's Lyes and Slanders were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, I am ſatisfied from my own Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his Books and Papers, they would fill up ſome Sheets of Paper, for many Pages in his Pamphlets are ſtuffed with them.</p>
                     <p>I know <hi>J. C.</hi> was much concerned, whilſt I was ſpeaking, in looking up his Notes, and receiving Papers from the Hands of ſome one or other of his Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; and it was obſerved by many, that he took little notice of what I ſaid, or replyed little directly to it, but diſputed by his Notes; and when his Notes were gone through, he had done: Yet ſure, if he heeded not, he could do no leſs than hear that I ſpoke ſomething before his Books were produced, though not in favour to his Cauſe; therefore I have
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:42082:95"/>ground to believe, that what he heard and took notice of, he hath wilfully omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to relate. But to the Paſſages in his Books.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>J. C.</hi> relates, <hi>That in his Book,</hi> Quakeriſm ſubverted, <hi>he ſaith, If the Light within be altogether blameleſs, the</hi> Quakers <hi>are in the right.</hi> And elſe-where in the ſame Book, <hi>There is ſomething of God in every Man, and ſomething of Satan and the Fleſh: But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if by ſomething of God, he thinks I mean a Meaſure or Part of God's Eſſence or Being, I renounce any ſuch Expoſition as Blaſphemy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply,</hi> 'Tis right <hi>J.

C.</hi> no where confuted) <hi>which is the Light of Men,</hi> John 1.4. <hi>with which every Man is enlightned</hi> (as <hi>J. C.</hi> hath aſſerted, pag. 21. of the ſame Book) <hi>be utterly blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, the</hi> Quakers <hi>are in the right, and all that he hath written againſt them falls to the Ground, and he will confeſs himſelf utterly defeated, and to have loſt the Day.</hi> And in p. 27, 28. of the ſame Book, he ſaith, <hi>In every Man there is ſomething of God,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:42082:96"/>ſomething of Satan, Fleſh and Spirit, Light and Darkneſs.</hi> Mark, Reader, <hi>J. C.</hi> hath not confuted our Aſſertion, <hi>That the Life of God is the Light of Men,</hi> &amp;c. but hath affirmed, That the Light within is the Light wherewith Jeſus Chriſt, the true Light, enlightneth every Man that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the World, pag. 21. as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid; which Light (within) he ſaith is ſomething of <hi>God, Spirit, Light.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now God is a Spirit, <hi>John</hi> 4.24. God is Light, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.5. Obſerve, he doth not ſay, ſomething of God's, or that may be called his; but ſomething of God, Light, Spirit; which ſomething of God, being Light and Spirit, muſt it not needs be ſomething of God's Eſſence or Being, whoſe Eſſence or Being is Light, Life and Spirit? For it cannot be the entire Fulneſs that is in every Man; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt it not needs be ſomething of the Fulneſs, a Manifeſtation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, according to the Scripture? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9. For <hi>in him dwelleth all the Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the God-head Bodily.</hi> John 1.16. <hi>Of his Fulneſs have we all received, and Grace for Grace.</hi>

                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:42082:96"/>
                     <p> But though <hi>J. C.</hi> hath aſſerted ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in every Man, yet before he will grant it to be any thing of God's Eſſence or Being, fearing the Conſequence (to wit) his Overthrow, and that he ſhould be utterly defeated, and loſe the day, he will deny God to be Omnipreſent, and count it Blaſphemy to aſſert that there is any thing of God's Eſſence or Being in Man. But if this were Blaſphemy to aſſert, then were <hi>J. C.</hi> guilty: For (that he may appear the ſame contradictory <hi>J. C.)</hi> though in pag. 16, and 17. he counts it Blaſphemy to affirm that there is any thing of God's Eſſence or Being in Man; yet in pag. 4. of the ſame Book, viz. <hi>A Warning to Souls,</hi> he affirms, <hi>That God's Eſſence and Eſſential Preſence is every where;</hi> and I am ſure in Man, for he is ſomewhere; therefore God's Eſſence is in Man, according to <hi>J. C</hi>'s Aſſertion; and if ſo, whether meaſurably, or in Fulneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> ſomething of the Eſſence of God, or the whole Fulneſs of God, whom the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain, let the Reader judge. But I deny it to be Blaſphemy to ſay, That ſomething of God's Eſſence is in Man; and affirm it to be Blaſphemy to deny
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:42082:97"/>any thing of God's Eſſence to be in Man (of which <hi>J. C.</hi> is guilty, and yet affirms God's Eſſence and Eſſential Preſence to be every where, which is flat Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to himſelf) for God is an infinite Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, whoſe Preſence fills Heaven and Earth, who is exempted from no place, but is preſent every where, therefore in Man, his holy Spirit in Man, his Eſſence or Being in Man, his Light and Life in Man, which is holy and blameleſs for ever, according to Scriptures, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.20. <hi>James</hi> 1.13. and never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to Sin; therefore all that <hi>J.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply,</hi> It is true, I did conclude, and alſo prove <hi>J. C.</hi> at the Diſpute, a Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite out of his own Mouth: I ſhall lay down his words, as ſpoken by him, and publiſhed to the World, in his Book of <hi>Prayer,</hi> pag. 141. <hi>I am compelled to Pray Hypocritically, and Diſſemble with God, and utter <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntruths to him that ſearcheth the Hearts, and delighteth not but in upright Lips.</hi> Theſe are <hi>J. C</hi>'s words, word by word: Upon which I thus argue, He that ſaith he prays Hypocritically, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles with God, and utters Untruths to the Searcher of Hearts, confeſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Hypocrite, a Deceiver, and a Lyar. But <hi>J. C.</hi> ſaith, He Prays Hypocritically, Diſſembles with God, and utters Untruths to the Searcher of Hearts; therefore <hi>John Cheyney</hi> confeſſes himſelf a Hypocrite, a Deceiver, and a Lyar; and was ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of his own Mouth.</p>
                     <p>My Charge againſt him, That he was a Lyar and a Deceiver, was by me at the Diſpute, proved to the full; and ſtands over his Head to this day. And it ſeems
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:42082:98"/>
                        <hi>J. C.</hi> at the laſt hath cried <hi>Peccavi.</hi> It is much for ſo hot a Skirmiſher to retract any thing he hath ſpoken, and eſpecially to publiſh his Recantation to the World; he tells his Reader, <hi>If thoſe words were out of his Book, they ſhould not ſo be in;</hi> judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it an Incommodious Expreſſion, which he ſhould have avoided; and wiſheth, <hi>It had not been ſaid.</hi> Yet he queries, <hi>What if theſe Words, and the Book, had not been writ?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply,</hi> Taking it for granted, that by theſe words, and his Book, he is proved a Hypocrite, a Deceiver, and a Lyar; yet I ſay, before this Book was written, he was a Hypocrite, a Deceiver, and a Lyar; and ſo I could have proved him, if this Book had never been written. But <hi>J. C.</hi> ſure concludes, becauſe I took this way, I had no other; but that is falſe. Yet taking this way for proof of my Charge, I may truly ſay, I needed no other; ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Proof being made.</p>
                     <p>What fuller and clearer Proof, that a Man is an Hypocrite, to the ſatisfaction of an Auditory, can be made, than his own Confeſſion? Though we may not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a Man to be every thing that he ſays he is, or every thing that he ſays of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:42082:98"/>himſelf, to be true; yet ſure when a Man ſaith, He is what he is, and ſays of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf what is true, we have juſt ground to believe him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>J. C.</hi> ſaith, <hi>He Prayeth Hypocritically, Diſſembles with God, and utters <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntruths to the Searcher of Hearts.</hi> And in page 45. of the ſame Book, <hi>There is much deteſtable Hypocriſie committed by us, in our ſolemn Prayers to God, both in ſecret, in private, and in publick.</hi> He ſaith in page 130. <hi>I am diſtracted in Prayer; I am ſoon weary; I come poorly off; my Foes are too hard for me—Why go I mourning all the day long, when the Comforter, which ſhould relieve my Soul, is gone from me?</hi> Alſo, in page 145. <hi>I Tremble to have my Luke-warm Prayers ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred by God, and ſpued out of his Mouth, and caſt in my Face as Dung.</hi> And ſeveral more ſuch like Confeſſions to his Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, which in his <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> may be ſeen; which, for brevity ſake, I paſs by.</p>
                     <p>Now, I do believe, that what <hi>J. C.</hi> hath confeſſed and ſaid of himſelf is true, That he Prays Hypocritically, Diſſembles with God, and Lyeth to the Almighty; that there is deteſtable Hypocriſie (the Character of an Hypocrite) committed
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:42082:99"/>by him in his Prayers to God; that he is Diſtracted in Prayer; that the Comforter, which would relieve his <hi>Soul,</hi> is gone from him; and that he may tremble to have his Luke-warm Prayers abhorred by God, and caſt in his Face like Dung: And why any impartial Man ſhould believe to the contrary, I ſee no Reaſon. It is a Maxim in Law, grounded upon Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>That a Man's Evidence may be believed againſt himſelf, though not for himſelf.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth <hi>J. C.</hi> himſelf retract any thing he hath ſaid of his deteſtable Hypocriſie, Diſtraction, and Lukewarmneſs in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; which are ſigns and tokens of an Hypocrite; nor of the Comforter being gone from his <hi>Soul,</hi> which is a deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble State; yet this ſeems not ſo much to be his Trouble, as that he hath not ſo worded the matter; but that every one, who believes what he hath ſaid of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be true, muſt conclude him a Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, a Deceiver, and a Lyar, out of his own Mouth: And though he be all this, and hath both confeſſed and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed it to the World, yet he would not be ſo accounted.</p>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:42082:99"/>
                     <p> Further, <hi>J. C.</hi> after his Recantation, ſaith, <hi>If</hi> R. H. <hi>and his Friends, would but read that Book with the ſame Spirit that it was writ, this had not needed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply, R. H.</hi> doth not believe that <hi>Book</hi> was writ by the Inſpiration of God; for then there had been no need of a Recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. But <hi>J. C.</hi> wiſheth, <hi>That ſome Words had been left out, and ſome Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in his Book had not been ſaid:</hi> Doth he not therefore Repent they were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten? And <hi>R. H.</hi> deſires not to read either that Book, or any other, with that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed lying ſpirit, which acted him that writ that Book; but with the Spirit of God, which tries and judges all falſe ſpirits. The Lyes, Contradictions, Slanders, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions and Blaſphemy, that is broached in that <hi>Book,</hi> is proof ſufficient, that it was not written by the Inſpiration of God; but that a lying blaſpheming ſpirit hath entered and acted him that writ it; and the Spirit of God in and through <hi>R. H.</hi> and his Friends, judges the Book, and that ſpirit by which it was writ. But would not <hi>J. C.</hi> if he could, perſwade <hi>R. H.</hi> and his Friends, to believe, That <hi>Book</hi> was written by Inſpiration, and that he was Inſpired by God to write it?
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:42082:100"/>if this be the thing he aims at, he hath evidently manifeſted his Folly, who hath denied the infinite Spirit of God to be in Man; and yet would he have us to read his Book with the ſame Spirit by which it was writ: Doth he not mean the Spirit of God? If not, then would he not have <hi>R. H.</hi> and his Friends, read his Book with another Spirit than the Spirit of God? And ſo might they be blind and deluded like himſelf; and call Good, Evil; and Evil, Good; put Light for Darkneſs, and Darkneſs for Light: But if at this he aimed, he is like to come off with Shame. For <hi>R. H.</hi> and his Friends, can joyn to no other Spirit but the Spirit of God, which ſearcheth all things, even the deep things of God; by which ſpirit they judge him, and that wicked ſpirit that acts him, and the works of both.</p>

                        <hi>J. C.</hi> in pag. 18. concludes, <hi>There is no Prayer made, but there is Contradiction between the Heart and the Tongue</hi>—he queries, <hi>Doſt thou perceive none? If not, thou art a graceleſs, proud, unhumbled Soul, and altogether a Stranger to God, and to right Prayer; if yea, then there is ſomething of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie in thy Prayer.</hi>

                     <p> 
                        <hi>Reply,</hi> No manvel if <hi>J. C.</hi> be diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Prayer, for he is diſtracted about it, and indeed about the moſt of the things of God he meddles with, which are too high for him: Doth he not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude him to be a Stranger to God, and to <hi>right Prayer,</hi> a <hi>graceleſs, proud, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humbled Soul,</hi> who prays without <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie;</hi> and that not to be <hi>right Prayer,</hi> which hath not ſomething of <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> in it; or that there is no Prayer made wherein the Heart and Tongue perfectly go together? This is in order to juſtifie his hypocritical Praying, Diſſembling with God, and uttering Untruths to him that ſearcheth the Heart; for he ſaith, <hi>Far be it from me to ſay, There is nothing of corrupt Nature within me, defiling my Prayers.</hi> What <hi>J. C.</hi> both before and here hath ſaid of himſelf, I believe; that his Prayers are defiled, and that there is <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> in them; in this <hi>J. C.</hi> and <hi>R. H</hi> both agree: But that Right Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is not without <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> and that he is a Stranger to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>right Prayer,</hi> who Prays without Hypocriſie; or that he is a graceleſs proud Soul who feels no Contradiction between his Heart and his Tongue, but his Heart perfectly goes
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:42082:101"/>along with his Tongue in Prayer, I deny; and aſſert, that right Prayer is without Hypocriſie; and that he that Prays right, his Heart and Tongue perfectly go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and he is not a proud unhumbled Soul, neither a Stranger to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>right Prayer,</hi> who perceives no contradiction between his Heart and his Tongue. This is ſo evident a Truth, that none, who pray with the Spirit and with Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, can deny. <hi>John Cheyney,</hi> tho' in contradiction to himſelf, hath largely confeſſed hereunto in his Book of <hi>Prayer,</hi> pag. 76. he ſaith, <hi>The Spirit of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and moves to</hi> Prayer. Pag. 7. <hi>All right</hi> Prayer <hi>muſt be in the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; which is not ſo to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, as if the bare naming of Chriſt were enough.</hi> Mark, the bare naming of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not enough; for all right Prayer muſt be in the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Now, if ſo, that God commands and moves to Prayer by his Spirit, and that all right Prayer is in the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as certain it is; then all right Prayer is without Hypocriſie: For God moveth not by his Spirit to Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, neither is there Hypocriſie in the Name of Chriſt.</p>
                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:42082:101"/>
                     <p> Pag. 17. he ſaith, <hi>Who knows how to pray, to God farther than God ſhall teach and enable him?</hi> Pag. 20. <hi>We could do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Prayer without the ſpecial Help of God's Spirit.</hi> Here again <hi>J. C.</hi> grants, that none knows how to pray to God, further than God teaches them; and that nothing can be done in Prayer (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he means right Prayer) without the ſpecial Help of <hi>God's Spirit.</hi> Now it is plain, that God doth not teach any to Pray Hypocritically, and nothing being done in right Prayer without the ſpecial Help of God's Spirit, there can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Hypocriſie in right Prayer; for right Prayer is performed by the ſpecial Help of God's Spirit; and the Spirit of of God is not the Author of Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.</p>
                     <p>And ſince the Spirit of God cammands and moves to Prayer, engaging both Man's Heart and Tongue therein; it therefore follows, that through the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Help of God's Spirit, the Heart and Tongue of Man do perfectly go together <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n right Prayer; otherwiſe the Prayer cannot be ſaid to be right, neither accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto God.</p>

                     <p> But ſuch as would pray without God's Spirit, and would have others not to wait for the Motion of it (like <hi>J.

Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er)</hi> no doubt but ſuch have Hypocriſie in their Prayers, and are ſuch as draw near to God with their Tongues, but their Hearts are far from him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.13. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.8.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>J. C.</hi> ſtiles himſelf a <hi>Goſpel Miniſter,</hi> and would by others be accounted a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Chriſt;</hi> yet he counſels People, <hi>not to tarry till the Spirit moves them to Prayer,</hi> &amp;c. But ſure the like Counſel was never given by any faithful Miniſter of Chriſt; for they knew they could not Pray as they ought, but by the Spirit of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26.27. And <hi>J. C.</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſays, pag. 20. of his <hi>Prayer Book, Without the ſpecial help of God's Spirit we
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:42082:102"/>can do no Spiritual Work;</hi> and right Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is ſure a ſpiritual Work or Exerciſe, and therefore not to be performed or done, but with the Spirit of God.</p>
                     <p>Again, p. 21. he ſaith, <hi>When the Spirit of the Lord is from Man, he can do nothing; Prayer ſticks in his Mouth like Choak-Cheeſe.</hi> And yet this pretended Goſpel-Miniſter would put People upon to Pray without the Spirit; inſtead of tarrying (as he ſaith) till the Spirit moves them, they muſt provoke themſelves to Prayer. This indeed is the Way to make them Hypocrites, like himſelf; and if I mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake him not, he would not have People be ſincere and throughout Chriſtians; Is it not then ſome <hi>Medium</hi> that he would bring them to? Read him thy ſelf, and give judgment; in his <hi>Sermons of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie,</hi> p. 225. he ſaith, <hi>I had almoſt ſaid, Either be Sincere and Throughout</hi> Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>or keep where you are; but by no means Do Neither.</hi> Doth <hi>J. C.</hi> think it would hurt People to be ſincere throughout Chriſtians? If not, Why muſt they by no means do ſo? Would he always keep them Learning, and never have them come to the Knowledge of the Truth and be ſaved? They who have Eyes to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:42082:103"/>ſee with, may ſee the end of this Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry is to keep People in Sin, though he may in words ſpeak againſt it: For, tho' he hath not altogether ſaid, Either be ſincere and throughout Chriſtians, or keep where you are; yet he hath poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively ſaid, <hi>By no means, Do Neither:</hi> And ſince to be ſincere and throughout Chriſtians is the one ſtate, hath he not ſaid, By no means be ſincere and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſtians; ſince he hath abſolutely ſaid, <hi>By no means, Do neither?</hi> This I apprehend to be the drift of <hi>J. C</hi>'s Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that he would have Chriſtians to have ſome corrupt Nature in them, whilſt they are here, defiling their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and not to be holy, as God hath commanded, and perfect as the heavenly Father is perfect; which was the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.2. &amp; 20.7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.48.1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.16.</p>
                     <p>Would not <hi>J.

This he confeſſeth to be his own ſtate; and further adds, in the ſame page, <hi>But either it muſt be ſo in part, or there will be no praying in this Word.</hi> And
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:42082:103"/>muſt there either be Hypocritical Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Diſſembling with God, and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Untruths unto the Searcher of Hearts, or no Praying in this World?

                     <p>I do believe it is ſo with <hi>J.

His Preparation to be gone was noted by many of the Auditory before he went; and when he turn'd his back on me, a Friend ſaid to him, <hi>Stay and prove thy Charge;</hi> and one of his Brethren, a Prieſt. who had ſtood with him, lifted up his Stick againſt the Friend, and threatned to <hi>knock him down, if he would not hold his Peace,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <p>I kept ſpeaking (after the Prieſts were gone) to the Auditory remaining, and ſome other of my Brethren after me, for ſome time; and the Power of God was over all, and the Teſtimony of Truth got room in many Hearts; and the Event hath proved, That that Day's ſervice tended to the Honour of Truth, which prevailed, and was advantagious to many ſimple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted People in thoſe parts; who ſince have turned their Backs on the Prieſts, and enclined their Ears to a better <hi>Teacher,</hi> even the Spirit of Truth, which leads into all Truth; which cauſeth the <hi>Prieſts</hi> to rage, and ſome People to cry out, (as common Fame is) <hi>They will all turn Quakers.</hi>

                     <p>All theſe are groſs Lyes, and wicked Slanders, whereof the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and their Religion, are clear. And that no Lye may remain upon the Truth, the Light, and Children thereof, I add, That the Light of Chriſt within Man, wherewith Chriſt the true Light lighteth every Man,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:42082:107"/>is the Life of the Word, the <hi>Light of Men,</hi> John 1.4. <hi>The Spirit of God given to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them,</hi> Neh. 9.20. Ezek. 36.27. <hi>The Manifeſtation of which Spirit is given to every Man to profit withal,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.7. <hi>The Spirit of Truth, which proceedeth from the Father,</hi> John 15.26. <hi>Reproves the World of Sin,</hi> John 15.8. <hi>And maketh manifeſt all things that are reproved,</hi> Epheſ. 5.13. For that is the Spirit of Truth which reproveth and convinceth of Sin; and the Spirit of Truth is the Spirit of Chriſt; <hi>for Chriſt is the Truth,</hi> John 14.6. And the Spirit of Chriſt is the Spirit of God; <hi>for the Son and the Father are One,</hi> John 10.30. &amp; 5.18, to 27. <hi>One Lord, one God, and Father of all,</hi> Epheſ. 4.5, 6. <hi>Chriſt and God is Light,</hi> John 1.4, 9. &amp; 8.12. &amp; 9.5. 1 John 1.5. <hi>The Lord our God is one Lord,</hi> Deut. 6.4. <hi>God is a Spirit,</hi> John 4.24. <hi>The Lord is that Spirit which giveth Life,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.6, 17. <hi>The changing of Man from Death to Life is by the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. <hi>I the Lord ſearch the Heart, and try the Reins, even to give every Man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doing,</hi> Jer. 17.10. <hi>The Spirit ſaith, I am he which ſearcheth the Reins and Hearts, and I will give unto every one of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:42082:107"/>you according to your Works,</hi> Rev. 2.23. <hi>The Spirit ſearcheth all things,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.10. Hereby it is evident, the Spirit of God is one with God and Chriſt, and ſo God Infinite, Omnipreſent, who is <hi>One Lord, and his Name One,</hi> Zach, 14.9. who ſees all things; there is nothing hid, or can be hid from <hi>God's Spirit,</hi> all things being known and ſeen by the <hi>Spirit of God;</hi> Man's Thoughts are ſhewed and told by it; and whatſoever thing is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, it ſheweth and maketh manifeſt; <hi>And that which makes manifeſt, is Light,</hi> Eph. 5.13.</p>
                     <p>Well then, the Spirit of Truth is the Light of Chriſt within Man, which makes manifeſt and ſheweth whatſoever thing is reproved by it; which decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to Man the Thoughts of his Heart, and giveth to every Man according to his Works, which reproveth and convinceth Man of Sin, and leads into all Truth; in which, we called <hi>Quakers</hi> have believed, and walk in, even in the Light and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God and Chriſt, and ſo witneſs the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſing us from all Sin, and the Light and Spirit of Chriſt leading us on together into all Truth; in which bleſſed Light we have
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:42082:108"/>Fellowſhip with God, who is Light, and one with another, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.5.7. And ſo are of that pure Religion which is undefiled before God, and unſpotted of the World, <hi>James</hi> 1.27. This bleſſed Light, or Spirit of Chriſt within, leads us to do unto all Men that which is right in the ſight of God; and all of us that walk in in it, walk according to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, Doctrines and Commands of God, contained in the Scriptures, and witneſs in meaſure, the fulfilling of what is therein written for our Learning, that the Man of God may be Perfect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the keeping of the great Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is <hi>Love.</hi> So then this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Light, or Spirit of Chriſt within, born witneſs to, and walked in, by us called <hi>Quakers,</hi> which indeed is both our Rule and Way, doth lead and guide us not to oppoſe God's Spirit (for then we ſhould oppoſe our Rule and Way, which is the Spirit of God) nor to pluck up by the Roots all the Doctrines, Precepts and Commands of Knowledge, Worſhip and Obedience touching God, contained in the <hi>Scriptures of Truth,</hi> as <hi>J. C.</hi> hath ſlandered us; but to live and walk there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and up thereunto, and manifeſt both
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:42082:108"/>our Love and Honour to the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> and Eſteem for the <hi>Scriptures of Truth,</hi> in living that Holy Life the Scriptures declare of, and the Spirit of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; which Holy Life lived by us through the Spirit, fulfils and juſtifies the Scriptures of Truth, and exalts and glorifies the Spirit of God over all; for God alone is worthy for ever and ever.</p>
                     <p>Neither doth the Light and Spirit of Chriſt, wherein the <hi>Quakers</hi> walk, and by which they are led and taught, lead them to teach Treaſon and Rebellion, which <hi>J. C.</hi> moſt wickedly hath charged the <hi>Quakers</hi> withal; but the Light teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and leadeth them to live peaceably and quietly under the Government where they are placed, and to ſeek the good of all Men, to Pray for Kings, and them which are in Authority, that under their Government, they might live in all God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Honeſty, a Quiet and Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Life, to Exhort one another to Love and good Works, and to teach Fidelity and Obedience to the Governments, and Governours, appointed by God; that both Magiſtrates and their Governments may be ſubmitted unto, and obeyed (by all
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:42082:109"/>People that there-under live) by doing or ſuffering what cannot for Conſcience ſake God-ward be done; and that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may anſwer the King and his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in ſuffering for Conſcience God-wards, not to ſeek Revenge, nor the Hurt of the King or his Government; but to leave Judgment to God alone, who diſpoſeth of Kingdoms and Thrones, Government and Kings, at his pleaſure; and to Pray to God, to perſwade the Hearts of Kings to fear him, to be Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragers of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> but to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage all <hi>Wickedneſs,</hi> and to Honour Chriſt, the Lord, the true Light over all, (who purgeth the Conſcience from dead Works, and fills it with the Myſtery of the living Faith) that over Conſcience Chriſt may only Rule and Govern, whoſe Right it is; that in ſo doing their Government may be bleſſed, to their Comfort, and the Benefit of the People, and the Honour and Glory of God, who is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, the Almighty God, bleſſed over all for ever, and for evermore.</p>
                     <p>So then the <hi>Quakers</hi> ever were, and are clear from teaching Rebellion or Treaſon againſt the King or his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:42082:109"/>And is it not plain their Principle and Practice is to do good unto all Men, whether Rulers or Ruled, as much as in them lieth? And is it not plain, that <hi>J. C.</hi> who thus wickedly ſlanders and belyes the <hi>Quakers,</hi> is a Man of that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, who would drink up the <hi>Quakers</hi> Blood, and remove them out of the King's Government, if it were but in his Power? But Limits are ſet for the proud Waves, and the high Thoughts of the Hypocrites ſhall periſh; and they that walk in the Light ſhall be ſaved, and all their Goings eſtabliſhed.</p>
                     <p>The Light and Spirit of Chriſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Quakers</hi> walk, by which they are taught and led, leads and teaches them to fulfil the fifth Commandment, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Honour to Parents in the Lord, and obeying them in all things that is well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to the Lord, in which they feel the Promiſe of God, Eternal Life; and ſo they make not void the fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, as <hi>J. C.</hi> wickedly ſaith.</p>
                     <p>Neither doth the Light and Spirit of Chriſt, wherein the <hi>Quakers</hi> walk, by which they are taught and led, teach them to aboliſh the Scriptures, nor ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Rule of Duty between Maſters
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:42082:110"/>and Servants, between Husbands and Wives, between Parents and Children, between Miniſters and People, as <hi>J. C.</hi> hath ſlandered the <hi>Quakers:</hi> But the Light leads and teaches the <hi>Quakers</hi> to live the Life the Scriptures declare of, to the fulfilling of them; and to inform Maſters and Servants, Husbands and Wives, Parents and Children, Miniſters and People, of the Rule of their Duty to God, and one another, by turning their Minds from Darkneſs to Light; that God placing his Fear in their Hearts, and ordering them all by his Light and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in their inward Parts, they might all know the Rule of their Duty, and walk in it one towards another, and ſo exalt it by walking in it, and living the Life of it before one another; and to exhort them that are turned to the Light, to walk in it, and do their Duty to God and one another fully, that the Life of Love and Purity may ſhine through them all, over all, to the Glory of God. And therein (to wit, the Light and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt) Maſters walking, will forbear threatning their Servants, and do unto them that which is juſt and equal, knowing their Maſter is Chriſt,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:42082:110"/>with whom there is no Injuſtice nor Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
                     <p>Servants therein walking, will be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to their Maſters in all things, not with Eye-ſervice, as Men-pleaſers, but as the Servants of Chriſt, doing the Will of God in ſingleneſs of Heart, knowing that of the Lord they ſhall receive the Reward of the Inheritance, Peace with God.</p>
                     <p>Husbands therein walking, will love their Wives as their own Body; for he that loveth his Wife, loveth himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Wives therein walking, will ſubmit themſelves unto their Husbands, and to them be ſubject, as it is comely in the Lord: And both Husbands and Wives will then live together in Love, as they are <hi>Heixs together of the Grace of Life,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.7.</p>
                     <p>Parents therein walking, will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke their Children to Wrath, but bring them up in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Children therein walking, will obey their Parents in all things that is well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Miniſters therein walking, every one as they have received the Gift from God,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:42082:111"/>will miniſter and ſpeak as the Oracle of God, that God in all things may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, and be blameleſs, and pure, holy Miniſters of Chriſt, without Rebuke, ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as Lights in the World.</p>
                     <p>People therein walking, will be at Peace among themſelves, and patient to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all Men, and have the Miniſters of Chriſt in Eſteem and Love for their Work's ſake, who admoniſh and labour in the Power of God amongſt them, and declare the Word of Truth to them, over whom they have a Care and Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight in the Lord, being of that Faith which gives Victory over the World, the end of whoſe Converſation is Eternal Life.</p>
                     <p>So then, in the Light and Spirit of Chriſt all that believe and walk, perform their Duty to God, to one another, and to all People, and honour and exalt the Everlaſting Rule, in living a Life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted of the World, and ſo of God are abundantly bleſſed.</p>
                     <p>Neither doth the Light and Spirit of Chriſt, wherein the <hi>Quakers</hi> walk, and by which they are taught and led, lead and teach them to pluck down Prayer, Root and Branch, or pray none at all,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:42082:111"/>or to pray Curſes and Blaſphemies, as <hi>J. C.</hi> wickedly ſlanders them. But it (<hi>viz.</hi> the Light) leads and teaches the <hi>Quakers</hi> to pray to God aright, to pray in the Holy Ghoſt; for of themſelves they know not how to pray, as they ought to pray, but the Spirit it ſelf maketh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt for them according to the Will of God, and they do pray to God in Spirit, and with an Underſtanding; and God, who is Light, who is a Spirit, hears them, and anſwers their Prayers, and is a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unto them, and daily gives them that thing which is convenient, and feeds them with the Bread of Life, which is their Meat indeed, whereby they are ſtrengthned to perform in all things the Will of God; and renews their Love and Obedience to God, the earneſt of whoſe Spirit is in their Hearts, aſſuring them of an Inheritance in the Kingdom of Chriſt; for the full enjoyment and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of which, they daily pray to God in his Spirit to preſerve them, and keep them worthy to the end, that they may fully inherit that Crown of Glory, which God in his appointed time will put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all them that ſincerely and fully love him. And ſo Prayer by the <hi>Quakers</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:42082:112"/>and alſo by their Practice, is to God, to be put up and offered in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, by all that truly fear God; and the Rule of that Prayer which God hears, and anſwers, is God's Spirit; and in the Spirit of God, the Rule, all that pray to God, bleſs God, and ſpeak well of his Name, and exalt God, the Light, the true Light, Lord of all, over all, and finds with God Acceptance, and are of God, bleſſed with Eternal Life.</p>
                     <p>Neither doth the Light and Spirit of Chriſt, wherein the <hi>Quakers</hi> walk, and by which they are led and taught, lead and teach the <hi>Quakers</hi> to ſay, <hi>Every Man may make as good, if not a better Bible than this we have;</hi> or affirm, <hi>The Light in every Man to be a part of God, as a Drop of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fetcht from the Ocean, is part of it,</hi> as <hi>J. C.</hi> falſly accuſeth them; but the Light leads and teaches <hi>Quakers</hi> to ſay, <hi>The Light in every Man, wherewith Chriſt hath enlightned all Men, is the Life of the Word, the Spirit of God and Chriſt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from God, of God's Eſſence, not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided from God, as a Drop of Water may be from the Ocean:</hi> For the Eſſence and God-head cannot be divided, but remains indiviſible over all, through all, and in
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:42082:112"/>you all, as ſaith the Apoſtle. And that every Man is enlightned with the Light of Chriſt; and that the Light of Chriſt in every Man is perfect, not liable to mutation or alteration: And although every Man be lighted with the Light of Chriſt, which is perfect, yet every Man loves not the Light, neither believes in the Light; and becauſe every Man hath not Faith in the Light, every Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pleaſe God; for, without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God; and every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing Man, who loveth his evil Deeds, hateth the Light, becauſe it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſteth his evil Deeds; and he that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Light, can neither ſpeak nor write by the Inſpiration of God; and he that ſpeaketh or writeth, and not by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of God, can neither ſpeak forth, nor write better, or ſo well, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles of God and Chriſt, who gave forth the Scripture of Truth, as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt. So then every Man cannot make ſo good, much leſs a better Bible than that which we already have. This the <hi>Quakers</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm; and ſo <hi>J.

But <hi>Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Lyes</hi> and <hi>falſe Doctrine,</hi> are ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in his Books, and the ſtrength and ſubſtance of them anſwered and laid open in ſeveral Books lately printed, in anſwer to ſeven of his confuſed, ſelf-contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Blaſphemous Pamphlets; this cuts my Work the ſhorter to the ſaid An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers: I refer the Reader for further

                     <p>
                        <hi>J. C.</hi> ſaith, <hi>There is nothing within or without us, that doth or can make known to us ſuch Supernatural Verities without the Scriptures, and what is derived from them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply,</hi> That the Scriptures (much leſs any thing derived from them) are God (who is Omnipreſent and Omnipotent, which the Scriptures are not) I deny; For God is a Spirit, an Infinite Subſtance, an independent Being, whoſe Being is of himſelf, who was God Omnipreſent before the Scriptures were written, and is God Omnipotent, who without the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, can do of himſelf whatſoever he pleaſes; and who ſhall ſay unto him, <hi>What doſt thou?</hi> Now God being a Spirit, Omnipreſent (preſent every where) Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent, he can make known ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Verities without the Scriptures, and what is derived from them. But <hi>J. C.</hi> hath affirmed the contrary in his Poſition. Whereupon I thus argue:</p>
                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:42082:115"/>
                     <p> 
                        <hi>He that affirms, That there is nothing within, or without us, that doth, or can make known to us ſuch Supernatural Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties without the Scriptures, and what is derived from them, denies God, who is Omnipreſent, to be Omnipotent, and is a Blaſphemer:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But</hi> J. C. <hi>hath affirmed, That there is nothing within, or without us, that doth, or can make known to us ſuch Supernatural Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities without the Scriptures, and what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Therefore</hi> J. C. <hi>denies God, who is Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipreſent, to be Omnipotent, and is a Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>J. C.</hi> ſaith, p. 24. <hi>Becauſe I have ſome Portion of the Genuine and Catholick Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Holineſs, I am mortally Hated by them; and yet I am as ill, or more, if more can be, Hated of many of mine own way, who agree with me in Opinion.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>That the <hi>Quakers</hi> mortally hate <hi>J.

Now that ſpirit whereby <hi>J. C.</hi> hath been acted in Diſſembling with God, and uttering Untruths unto him, in Diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:42082:116"/>with God, and uttering Untruths unto him, in belying the Light, and the Children of it, together with their pure and undefiled Religion; in Blaſpheming the Light of Chriſt (the Spirit of God) calling it, <hi>Diana, Dagon, a Dumb Idol,</hi> comparing it to a <hi>Drunken Coash-man,</hi> &amp;c. is a wicked ſpirit, which, together with <hi>J.

                     <p>And that many of <hi>J.

And the Lord is the ſame, who for his <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s ſake, is daſhing the Potſherds of the Earth one againſt another, and hath appeared, and is appearing againſt this <hi>J.

                     <p>Of a truth I can ſay, to the Praiſe of God who hath honoured you, The good Order of the Goſpel is amongſt you; and where ever yet I have Travelled, and what Methods ſoever I have veiwed, in the midſt of all, I on your behalf have bleſſed God for his Wiſdom, wherewith he hath endowed you: I hope, finding

In the mean while, dearly beloved, in humility dwell, and the Grace and Peace of God be daily multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied upon you, and let your fervent breathings, and earning deſires be for one another; and in a tender healing Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit be you always found, and evermore live together in Love; and for me, your younger Brother, who am outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeparated from you, and bound in Spirit for Travel in the labour of the Goſpel, Let your breathings in Life, to the God of Life be. That God will be pleaſed to give me a door of Ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance, and proſper the work in his hand, He hath called, and yet is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into, to the Praiſe of his own Glory.</p>

                     <p>DEar <hi>P. H. J. A. C. M. C. J. K. E. K.</hi> and all my Beloved Friends in <hi>Holland:</hi> To you all in the Covenant of Light, who are Called and Choſen of God, to be Heirs of Salvation and Life, is the tender Salutation of my Love ever to you; who are the Circumciſion, to whom the Adoption and Covenant appertains, who are bound to keep the Law (of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus) your Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion being that of the Heart, and of the Ear, that you may hear and do the Law of God, which is written upon the Tables of your Hearts, and be Witneſſes of the bringing in of the better Hope; which makes perfect, as appertaining to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, upon each of you: Beloved in God and Chriſt, my Love opens freely, my Life greets you often; your Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance lives with me, you are near me in Life; and in abiding Love is your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance refreſhing to me. As a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my Heart is open to you; the Breathings of my Life are for you, that the Circumciſed, Adopted and Choſen amongſt you, may keep the Everlaſting Covenant God hath made with you;
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:42082:119"/>that you may not only be the Called, but alſo the Choſen Faithful and True, who continue to the end, and be ſaved, through the Effects of the Hope brought in; which, whoſoever hath it, purifieth himſelf, even as he (the Author of the Hope and Salvation) is pure: For, my Beloved Friends, we are not ignorant how that many have made their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion Uncircumciſion, being turned with the Dogg to their vomit, and with the Sow that was waſhed to the wallowing in the Mire; and that too too many have broken Covenant with the Lord, and caſt his divine Law behind their backs; being turned from the Grace of God into La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciviouſneſs, and from Truth into a Lye; and in the Laſciviouſneſs and Lye, have ſtood up to oppoſe the Grace, and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay the Truth; their end will be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, their Damnation ſlumbereth not. We think it not ſtrange, that we meet ſometimes with Exerciſes of this kind; to wit, Perils amongſt falſe Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, Satan's Transformings; and the falling away of ſome who are gone out from us: For the Apoſtle ſpeaks of a <hi>Falling away, that the Son of Perdition ſhould be made manifeſt;</hi> and again it's
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:42082:120"/>ſaid, <hi>They went but from us, that they might be made manifeſt, that they were not of us.</hi> When <hi>Eve</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> fell away from God, they died the Death; the Devil and Satan was made manifeſt: When Man went or fell from Truth, to the Lye, the Lyar was made manifeſt; when <hi>Judas</hi> fell away, the Son of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was made manifeſt: And there hath been a falling away from Truth to the Lye, from God to the Devil, from Chriſt to Belial; and through the falling away is the Lye, Devil and Belial, made manifeſt in their Fleſh, whoſe Spirits fall away. Now as through their falling away, the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Perdition</hi> is made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, ſo are they made manifeſt to us to be <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>Belial,</hi> who are in the <hi>Gall of Bitterneſs, and Band of Iniquity;</hi> and from the <hi>Gall</hi> which they are in, bitter Fruits are brought forth by them, being Men of corrupt Minds; as to the Faith, Reprobates: And as <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> withſtood <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo do theſe Men reſiſt the Truth; they are Enemies to the Croſs of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I doubt not, my <hi>Friends,</hi> but that you have had your ſhare of Exerciſe with ſome who are gone out from you, or
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:42082:120"/>from the Truth, which is your Life; who probably may yet for ſome time have Aſſembled with you, that they might give you the greater Exerciſe; who, themſelves being of corrupt Minds, have endeavoured to corrupt others; and, <hi>Judas</hi> like, with a Kiſs betray Truth into the Hands of <hi>Sinners,</hi> and draw the weak and unſtable into the <hi>Snare</hi> with them; making the Weak to err, and turning the Feeble out of the way; which is a grief to the Upright-hearted: Not but that they ſee, that as <hi>Judas</hi>'s Kiſs could not cover his Treachery, no more can their Kiſſes cover their Treachery; for of all the Faithful, whoſe Eyes are in their Head, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they are ſeen and judged: But for the ſakes of the Weak and Feeble, deluded by them, and of the place it gives to the Devil, and great occaſion to the World, to Blaſpheme God, his Truth and People; it hath made ſad the Heart which God. hath not made ſad: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, my <hi>Friends,</hi> in and through theſe, and all other your Exerciſes, God hath been with you, ſanctifying Tribulations to you, and confounding thoſe that have ſet themſelves againſt you; on the one hand, and on the other, have they fallen
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:42082:121"/>that troubled you: To God, who is on your ſide, be all the Praiſe. What now remains to us, who know the Righteous God pleads our Innocent Cauſe, and that our Righteouſneſs is of the Lord, but that each of us who ſtand, take heed leſt we fall; and that we uſe all diligence to make our Calling and Election ſure, before we go hence, and be no more ſeen? Let the feeble Knees amongſt you be made ſtrong, that not one that is halting may be turned out of the way; and let the ſtrong of you be more ſtrong: You Fathers and Elders, that know him that was from the beginning; and you young Men and Brethren, who are ſtrong, who have overcome the wicked One in you; the Word of God abiding: Being as the Watch-Men in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> amongſt the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion; and as Saviours upon Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> unto the hindermoſt of them who worſhip God in Spirit.</p>
                     <p>And all of you, who are <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to whom Circumciſion was given, who was to Circumciſe himſelf, the Males in his Houſe, his Sons, and his Servants bought with his Money: Be you all Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed; and when all Filthineſs of Fleſh and Spirit is done away, then keep you
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:42082:121"/>Covenant with God, whoſe the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion is, who hath given you the anſwer of a good Conſcience: For as Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the Fleſh appertained to the Firſt Covenant, and they that were Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, were bound to keep the Law of the Firſt Tables; ſo Circumciſion in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit appertains to the Second Covenant, and the Circumciſed are bound to keep the Law of the Second Table. And thoſe that will loſe their Life, they through Death ſhall come to have Life: And ſuch are Witneſſes, that the New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture avails; ſo that all the Circumciſion may have that which avails, the New Creature, which is Created after God in Righteouſneſs and perfect Holineſs; for as it was ſaid, <hi>Neither Circumciſion, nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion availeth, but a New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> Now where this New Creature is known, the Old Man with his Deeds is put off; the Old Man, and Old Creature put off, and changed; the New Man is put on; and the New Creature, which bears the Image of the Heavenly, comes up.</p>
                     <p>Now where any have a fooliſh pity to the Firſt Birth, being bent to ſave its Life, there is in them an averſeneſs to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:42082:122"/>the cutting off of the fore-skin of the Heart, for the ſake of your Blood; theſe are like him that pitied <hi>Agag,</hi> whoſe Life God had required, they ſpare that which God would have cut off: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let no ones Eye pity, not Hand ſpare, but let the fore skin of all Hearts be cut off, that all filthineſs of Fleſh and Spirit may be done away; and that not only in the Fathers, Elders, young Men, Brethren, but in them of younger Years, and leſs growth: And concerning this, let the Elders, Fathers and Brethren, be careful that all the fore-skins of the Hearts of <hi>Abraham's</hi> Houſe-hold, of his Children, who are of the Houſe-hold of Faith, be cut off, that they may all know the Circumciſion: And in Heart and Ear being circumciſed, may all keep the Law of God; in keeping of which Law, there is a great Reward: And the more ſet them be careful, that all be Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, and that the Circumciſion be kept, leſt it becoming Uncircumciſion in any, and being winked at, it becomes like a ſpreading Leproſie upon them that have been Circumciſed, drawing a fore-skin over their Hearts again, as a covering to their Filthineſs, whereby their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:42082:122"/>is made Uncircumciſion, and their latter end worſe than the beginning; <hi>For it had been better,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>they had never known the way of Truth, than after they had known, to turn from it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And Dear Friends, provoke you one another, and be provoked one by another to Love, and to good Works: Be all ſtedfaſt in the Faith; ſpeak all by one Spirit, and you will ſpeak one thing; be Encouragers in what is Good, a Praiſe to them that do Well, but a Terror to Evil Doers: If there be Tatlers, Buſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodies amongſt you, Mark ſuch, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them: Let none ſtrengthen Evil Doers, but appear in Judgment againſt their Evil Deeds, for that is the way to do them Good: If any hath done Evil, let ſuch Repent, and do ſo no more, but come and do their firſt Work, leſt God ſmite them with a Curſe: If any Friend be overtaken with Weakneſs, reſtore ſuch an one in the Spirit of Meekneſs and Love; and let ſuch a one be eaſie to be entreated, for why ſhould any Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe his own Mercies? It's a Mercy from God to Offenders, that Men fearing God, come to them in the Love of God,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:42082:123"/>to tell them their Sin: This Mercy <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> though a King, rejected not, when <hi>Nathan</hi> ſaid, <hi>Thou haſt ſlain</hi> Uriah <hi>the Hittite, and taken his Wife;</hi> but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, ſaying, <hi>I have Sinned:</hi> Nathan replied, <hi>God hath taken away thy Sin, thou ſhalt not Dye.</hi> But Alas! how few are of <hi>David's</hi> Mind, when for their Offences they are ſpoken to?</p>
                     <p>Let all, Dear Friends, be Watchful, and let your Light ſhine; put not your Candle under either Bed or Buſhel; let not your Sleep be over it, nor your Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizing be above it, but let your Candle ſtand in the Candleſtick and Shine, giving Light over all: You are Light in that part of the World; ſo Shine, that Men ſeeing your good Works, may be occaſioned to bleſs God on your behalf: You are a City upon that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, you cannot be hid; you are the Salt of that Earth, therefore ſeaſon you that part of the Creation: They have Eyes upon you, looking for good from you; their Ears are ſometimes attentive to you, to reap of the Good proceeding from you; Good is with you, for God is with you; and for the Good proceeding from you, they ſhall glorifie God: Preach
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:42082:123"/>you Righteouſneſs to them in a holy Life, and be before them Patterns of Piety, in a Godly Converſation; Chriſt your Life, your Light, ſhining in you and through you, being both your Righteouſneſs, and exceeding great Reward; ſo do, that you may convince them of their Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, which is a Righteouſneſs of their own, which they are going about to eſtabliſh; which is but as <hi>filthy Rags,</hi> and as a <hi>menſtruous Cloth,</hi> in Compariſon of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, which they have rejected; that ſo they may ſee and be aſhamed; Repent, and find Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with the Lord, that they may be healed.</p>
                     <p>Finally, my Brethren, and all Dear Friends, live in Love, that God who is Love may dwell in you; that Grace, Peace, and all ſpiritual Bleſſings, in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, may be multiplied upon you, from God, the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Amen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As opportunity offers, give the <hi>Saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of my Dear Love, to all Dear Friends in <hi>Frizeland,</hi> at <hi>Frederickſtadt, Hambrough,</hi> and other places upon your Continent, where I have travelled; and the God of my Life, who is the Father of our Lord

                     <p>
                        <hi>Unto thee (who ſubſcribes thy Name</hi> Ralph Cheſter) <hi>there is a few Words upon our Minds, to impart, which are as followeth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Friend,</p>
                     <p>BY thy Letter to the Jaylor, and alſo by an Information from thee, to the Judge at the laſt Aſſizes, in order to Confine me, with ſome other of my Friends, to the common Goal here at <hi>Lancaſter:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We, whoſe names are hereunto ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, do underſtand that we are Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners at thy Suit, having ſo been for the ſpace of twenty Months, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; for the accompliſhing whereof, thou ſay'ſt it hath coſt thee 30 <hi>l.</hi> Now, Friend, in a plain Stile, for I may not give thee any flattering Titles (not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo learned of Chriſt) but in words of Truth and Soberneſs unto thee, who art called a <hi>Biſhop;</hi> it is with me to write, and that upon good Ground, as
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:42082:132"/>alſo having ſufficient Reaſons inducing me thereunto, Love to God, and love to thy Soul, and that my Conſcience may be Clear, and that by way of Query; leaving it to thy ſerious Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and to the Witneſs of God in thy Conſcience, to give an Anſwer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: Whether it was not an Unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Act of thee, to cauſe us to be caſt into Priſon, for no other cauſe, but that we (who own Chriſt Jeſus to be come, who is our Prieſt, and the Biſhop of our Souls, who overſees us, and takes care for us, and gives us freely, <hi>without Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and without Price;</hi> and becauſe we cannot deſtroy our Faith in him, nor lay waſte our Teſtimony concerning his Coming, and the free Teachings of his Spirit) could not with a ſafe Conſcience, and therefore refuſed, to pay thee Tithes; knowing of a Truth, that the Levitical Prieſthood, to which Tithes were due, is changed; and that Chriſt Jeſus, who is made <hi>a Prieſt, not after the Law of a carnal Commandment, but after the Power of an endleſs Life, A Prieſt for ever after the Order of</hi> Melchiſedeck, hath diſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled the Commandment, as is clear from <hi>Hebrews 7?</hi> And whether thy wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:42082:133"/>to the Jaylor, and incenſing the Judge againſt us; not only to infringe our Liberty, but if poſſible, deprive us of Life alſo, be not very Unchriſtian? Whether did ever Chriſt give ye any ſuch Command, that ſaid, <hi>Freely ye have, received, freely give?</hi> Or, the Apoſtles ſhew thee any ſuch Example, who ſaid, <hi>We Covet no Man's Silver, Gold, nor Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel?</hi> Or, whether thou that haſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon thee the Office of a Biſhop, which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, was a <hi>good Work,</hi> be in the Practice of thoſe things which the ſaid Apoſtle gave in Charge to <hi>Timothy,</hi> concerning Riſhops, that they ſhould be <hi>Blameleſs, Vigilant, Sober, no Striker; nor greedy of filthy Lucre: Not a Brawler, not Covetous; that he be not lifted up with Pride, leſt he fall into the Condemnation of the Devil?</hi> Alſo the ſame Apoſtle to <hi>Titus, A Biſhop muſt be Blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as the Steward of God, not ſelf willed,</hi> (mark) <hi>no Striker, not given to filthy Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre, one that holds faſt the Faithful Word, that he may be able by ſound Doctrine</hi> (mark, by ſound Doctrine) <hi>to Exhort and Convince gainſayers:</hi> And whether or no, if thou haſt been in the footſteps of theſe Primitive Biſhops, to whom <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <pb n="193" facs="tcp:42082:133"/>writ, ſuppoſing us to be without, to wit, <hi>Gainſayers,</hi> inſtead of ſpending 30 <hi>l.</hi> to caſt us into Priſon, and of threatning the Jaylor, and ſtirring the Judge againſt us; wouldſt thou not rather have labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by <hi>ſound Doctrine</hi> (mark, by ſound Doctrine, and not by caſting us into Priſon, whom thou haſt not ſo much as given the leaſt word of Exhortation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to) to have convinced us? But I query of thee, Whether did any of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles or Miniſters of Chriſt Jeſus caſt any Man into Priſon for denying to pay Tithes, or of whom did they ask the Tenths of their increaſe? If thou canſt, ſhew me ſuch a Preſident in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the New Teſtament: Or, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they did <hi>freely receive,</hi> and <hi>freely give,</hi> Yea or Nay; if Yea, then whether Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoning People, who cannot give their Money for that which is not Bread, be not a very unchriſtian Practice, and too much like the way of <hi>Cain,</hi> who was a Perſecutor, reſembling the Error of <hi>Balaam,</hi> who loved Gifts and Rewards? And whether ſuch as are in the Practice thereof, be not in the footſteps of thoſe Prophets <hi>Micah</hi> ſpoke of, that <hi>bite with their Teeth,</hi> and he that puts not in <hi>their
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:42082:134"/>Mouths,</hi> they <hi>prepare War</hi> even againſt him; and of ſuch as looked every one <hi>for his gain from his quarter?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Friend, Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Every Tree is known by his Fruits;</hi> And if thou be a Miniſter of Chriſt, the words of Chriſt will not offend; he ſaid, <hi>Not every one that ſaith, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; but he that doth the Will of my Father which is in Heaven:</hi> Such, as when he was Hungry, gave him no Bread to Eat; when he was Thirſty, gave him no Water to Drink; when he was Naked, did give him no Clothing; when Sick and in Priſon, did not viſit him; ſuch were ſhut out of the Kingdom of Heaven: For ſaid Chriſt, <hi>In as much as ye did it not unto them, ye did it not unto me:</hi> Now, if ſuch were ſhut out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, who did not theſe things unto Chriſt in his Members (mark) if ſuch as did not viſit Chriſt in his Members in Priſon, were ſhut out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven; What then will become of ſuch who Impriſon Chriſt's Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers?</p>
                     <p>Now, Friend, conſider thy Ways and thy Actions; Haſt thou done unto us, as thou thy ſelf would be done unto?
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:42082:134"/>Or, haſt not thou rather broken the Righteous Law of Chriſt? If by thy Works thou be not Juſtified, ſhalt not thou by thy Works be Condemned, ſince every Man muſt receive according unto his Deeds, be they Good, or be they Evil?</p>
                     <p>Now, If a Biſhop ſhould <hi>bite with his Teeth,</hi> and <hi>prepare War</hi> againſt an Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent People, becauſe they cannot put into his Mouth, and caſt them into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (ſome of which, neither owes him any thing, either according to the Law of God, or any Law of Man, as is known to ſome of his Agents: The like of which, I think, cannot be parallell'd by all the Impropriators and Prieſts in <hi>England:</hi> Beſides, yet done by, or at leaſt in the Name, and at the Suit of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop) and threatens the Jaylor with ſevere Puniſhment, if he ſuffer them to have any Liberty at all; and likewiſe ſtir up the Judge to ſtraiten their Bonds, that if poſſible, he might have the Lives of ſuch, for whom Chriſt dyed, and bring the Guilt of their Blood upon his Head.</p>
                     <p>I ſay, if a Biſhop have thus done, I Query, Whether this be the way for
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:42082:135"/>ſuch a Biſhop to ſtand approved in the ſight of God, and to be manifeſt to the Conſcience of all People, and to have a good Report of them which are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; or, rather the way to fall into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and the Snare of the Devil, and bring the Wrath and Judgment of God upon his Head?</p>
                     <p>So let the Witneſs of God in thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience Anſwer to theſe things: And the Lord God of Heaven and Earth, the Righteous Judge of all the Earth, whoſe Judgment is Juſt, Judge betwixt thee and us: And unto him we Appeal, with whom there is no reſpect of Perſons; who Judgeth the Cauſe of the Poor, and the Cauſe of the Rich; and to his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Witneſs in thy Conſcience, we alſo Appeal in this matter, Whether it be not more Chriſtian like, more according to Truth, the Example of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, who gave Commandment unto the Church, <hi>That they ſhould walk as they had them for Examples in Chriſt;</hi> which all true Chriſtians ought to follow, to ſer us at Liberty, than to keep us Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners until Death (having contrary to the Law enſnared us) and bring the Guilt of Innocent Blood upon his Head?</p>
                     <pb n="197" facs="tcp:42082:135"/>
                     <p> But, now Friend, if thou ſhalt ſay, It is becauſe you will not pay Tithes: I Anſwer, One of us, being one of the three thou impriſoned, and writ againſt, in order to ſtraiten our Bonds, hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing according to the Law of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Titheable, therefore wrongfully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, according to that Law, and ſo detained; and as to the other, who for Conſcience ſake refuſed to pay them, if thou canſt make good by the Scriptures of the New Teſtament, that Chriſt or his Apoſtles ſued any Man for Tenths or Tithes, and caſt them into Priſon if they would not pay them; give us Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Verſe for this, and let us ſee where it is ſo written, that Chriſt Jeſus, who has all Power in Heaven and Earth given unto him, made ſuch a Law, and gave it to his Diſciples, Apoſtles, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Ambaſſadors and Evangeliſts; and if ſo, let us ſee where it is written in the New Teſtament, and where his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Apoſtles did practice any ſuch Law; ſhew this plain Scripture unto us (and we, to wit, who have any thing Titheable, will pay thee Tithe) But if thou canſt not, art not thou a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor of the Command of Chriſt, that
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:42082:136"/>ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>Freely ye have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, freely give?</hi> So to be one that Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſes, and abideth not in the Doctrine of Chriſt, as thou may'ſt ſee in the ſe, cond Epiſtle of <hi>John,</hi> and the ninth Verſe.</p>
                     <p>And, did ever Chriſt or his Diſciples force any to hear them, and come to their Church; and if they would not, caſt them into Priſon? And did ever Chriſt and his Apoſtles force any that were not of their Church, to give them Maintenance or Tithes; and if they would not, caſt them into Priſon, and threaten the Jaylor to keep them Clofe? Now we deſire thee to ſatisfie us out of the New Teſtament, and give us Chapter and Verſe for theſe things, which thee, and you practice, and let us ſee where it is written; for the Apoſtle tells you, you are not to preſume above what is written, as thou may'ſt ſee in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. for thou being a Biſhop, oughteſt to ſatisfie us in a Scripture way: And ſo we thy Priſoners, deſire thy Epiſtle, and ſatisfaction from thee, by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the New Teſtament.</p>
                     <pb n="199" facs="tcp:42082:136"/>
                     <p> For our not paying thee Tithes, the Lord knows is not for Covetouſneſs or Rebellion, but for Conſcience ſake to our God; knowing that Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>Freely you have received, freely give;</hi> as thou mayſt ſee in <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. And what was ſet before them, that they might Eat; and if thou, or any of thy Miniſters, if they be Miniſters of the Goſpel, and abide in Chriſt's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, we will receive them, and thee, into our Houſes, and ſet before you Meat and Drink; and you ſhall freely Eat and Drink of our Carnal Things, if you have any Spiritual Things to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to us. And did ever Chriſt or his Apoſtles caſt any into Priſon without Admoniſhing of them, as thou haſt done us? Let us ſee where it is written. So we leave our Cauſe with the Lord: And as we are thy Priſoners, having laid theſe things before thee, whether thou wilt give thy Epiſtle, and ſhew us Chapter and Verſe for thy Practice; or, if thou canſt not, be ſilent: Or, whether thou wilt continue us, or ſet us at Liberty, we leave them with thee, and reſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied: For though in the World we have Tribulation, yet in him that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:42082:137"/>the World, we have Peace, which the World cannot take away; in which we reſt, whoſe names are, <hi>Roger Haydock, Heskin Fell,</hi> Priſoners.</p>
                     <p>The third Perſon by them impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and complained againſt, becauſe ſhe had Liberty, who by courſe of Law was releaſed; yet a Suit depending, and therefore a Sufferer for her Teſtimony, who with us, we joyn in what we have writ: Her name is,</p>

                     <p>And thus have I abreviated the Journal of my Fellow-labourer in the Goſpel, and dear Brother according to the Spirit, and Brother alſo according to the Fleſh; whoſe Unity and Fellowſhip in the Light was precious, being of one Mind in things relating to Truth, and the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline in the Church of Chriſt; as alſo, of the Doctrine and Precept of Chriſt, being joyned in the Truth, which is but one, and bound up together in the Bond of Life and Love in our Souls, to be one, and in the one Eternal Spirit, and Light of Life, together ſealed: And although he be removed from the Houſe of Clay or Duſt, which moved to and fro in the Counties, Iſlands, Countries and Kingdoms here below, wherein he
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:42082:145"/>bore a faithful Teſtimony to the Light, the Truth, the Life manifeſt within, in which he was ſupported and carried along in that weighty Work and Service in his Day, yet the Fruits of his Labours and Travels ſhew forth the Praiſe of God; and his Faithfulneſs, Uprightneſs and Zeal, to God and his Truth, is ſealed in many Hearts by the Spirit of Chriſt. From the time of his Convincement, to the time he was firſt moved by the Spirit of God to viſit the Churches of Chriſt, and Children of Light, was four Years; in which time Sufferings by Impriſonment he paſſed through, being young: Our Father's departure the 10th of the 7th Month, 1670. and burial the 12th of the ſame; and other hard Exerciſes which he paſt through, I at that time being in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the labour of the Goſpel, had but ſmall past thereof. From the firſt of his going abroad in the Work of the Miniſtry, to the time of his departure from hence, was twenty four Years and a half; in which time, not with ſtanding his Impriſonment, Sickneſs, and Weakneſs of Body and Family, he travelled by Sea, and by Land, by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, Thirty Two Thouſand Seven
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:42082:145"/>Hundred, Twenty Seven Miles; and miniſtred in Two Thouſand Six Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Nine Meetings or Churches, as his Journal plainly makes appear, which he writ down with his own hand from Day to Day, Weekly, Month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Yearly, to that very Day he was viſited, which was the 9th day of the 3d Month, 1696. as aforeſaid: And now having finiſhed the Account (I give) taken out of the Manuſcript of his Sufferings, Travels, Services and Zeal, as aforeſaid, add this furthur Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
                     <p>This my Friend, departed, was my younger Brother, begot by one Father, and brought forth by one Mother, and Born in <hi>Coppul,</hi> in the <hi>South part</hi> of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſhire,</hi> brought up, whilſt a Child, at School, and had ſome Learning; who, whilſt a Schollar, had an Exerciſe of Mind by the in-workings of the Light; but at that time attained not to the Knowledge of that good Spirit of God in his Heart, which was then at work in him; ſo that after it pleaſed God the Father, in the 7th Month, 1667. to viſit me by his Light in the inwards of my Heart, by which he powerfully
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:42082:146"/>work'd in me, until my Will was brought down, and ſubjected to the Will of God, and my Heart ſo fitted, that in it I ſaw Chriſt the Light, and Word of Eternal Life, and believed: After this, my ſaid Brother coming to my Father's Houſe, was by our Mother put on to Diſcourſe with me, ſhe being a Profeſſor, and inclined to the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi> Way, but quickly he was put to Silence, and confounded; ſo that being gone from me, in private, our Mother blaming him becauſe he ſo quickly let me alone and left me, ſaid to her, '<hi>Tis Truth, I dare not ſay againſt it:</hi> Thus what had before work'd in him whilſt a Schollar, to wit, the Light and Life of God, work'd now ſo powerfully and effectually in him, until he came to the Viſion and work of it, even Life Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal revealed in his Heart, and ſo in God believed, and became a faithful and true Witneſs (to the Eternal Life, <hi>which is the true Light that lighteth every Man</hi>) both in Sufferings by Impriſonments and Loſs of Goods, which he never ſhunned, neither ſought out an eaſier way, than that of the Croſs, continued Travel, Love-Services and Charity; he was
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:42082:146"/>greatly concerned in Watchfulneſs for the Wellfare and Peace of God's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; He was found in the Faith, of a blameleſs Converſation, Inſtrumental in turning many to Chriſt, Zealous for Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of Church Diſcipline, that all Superfluities might be at an end; and ſo the Church and Family of God appearing in brightneſs, might occaſion many eyes to look after that God that lives for ever and ever.</p>
                     <p>And although he was not the firſt that laboured through the Heat of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, yet in his time he ſtood faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in thoſe Trials he met with; He had a great eſteem of ſuch as were in Chriſt before him, and never grudged to let ſuch have the Preferrence; always eſteeming Elders that ruled well, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of double Honour; but if any ſought themſelves, or their own Repute, more than the Repute of Truth, this grieved him; but he having learned to bear, oftentimes left the remainder to God, who opened his Way: He had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times oppoſite Spirits to deal with, and ſuch as were not willing to be yoaked with the Yoak of Chriſt, who were for Liberty and Eaſe to the Fleſh: Yet,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:42082:147"/>under a ſeeming tenderneſs, at times would Nip the tender Buds: However, the Lord ſtood by him and helped him, ſo that his Teſtimony ſhined to the end, and the Remembrance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of lives: O! how precious was that Spring of Love and Life that aroſe in him when the Rubiſh was digged through, and the <hi>Philiſtine</hi>'s Nature di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and the <hi>Well</hi>'s Mouth opened; ſurely he was one that made uſe of his Staff, and leaned upon it, and digged with it until Water flowed forth, to the Watering the Flocks of God, to the Melting of many Hearts.</p>
                     <p>My Unity with him many a time was ſealed in my Heart, by the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Eternal Life; His Life was Chriſt my Life: Our Life, Chriſt, ariſing in us, made us manifeſt one to another, in the warming Beams of his Glory, to be one in Chriſt. He is gone a way, and left the Tabernacle below, and is entred the Tabernacle above, having already ceaſed from his Labours, to enjoy the Perfection of Peace and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for ever and ever. I yet remain to to fulfil what is behind in the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle below, waiting for my paſſage
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:42082:147"/>from hence, which I hope God the Father will make eaſie to me in the time appointed, and give me fully to enter the Tabernacle above, to enjoy the Perfection of Peace and Glory, and my Brother therein, with the Saints and Angels of Light for ever and ever,</p>

                  <head>A POSTSCRIPT.</head>
                  <p>My Brother, about 1674, or 1675, being at a Meeting at <hi>Freckleton</hi> in the <hi>Fylde,</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and brought to <hi>Preſton,</hi> before <hi>Edward Rigby,</hi> called Juſtice, who treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him very Roughly, and gave him many opprobrious Speeches, calling him, and one taken with him, <hi>Traytors,</hi> &amp;c. and fined him 20 <hi>l.</hi> for Preaching. This ſaid <hi>Rigby</hi> endeavoured to lay the Fine upon the Hearers; but my Brother told him, he had Goods of his own, better than 20 <hi>l.</hi> and therefore none ought to be impoſed upon becauſe of his Fine; <hi>Rigby</hi> ſaid he would have them.</p>
                  <p>Several Years after, this ſame <hi>Rigby,</hi> with others, was, in King <hi>James</hi>'s time, apprehended and ſent from <hi>Preſton</hi> to <hi>Cheſter,</hi> by <hi>Warrington;</hi> at which place, neither at <hi>Inn-houſes</hi> (many Soldiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Town) nor at private Houſes, could they get Entertainment, until my Brother took this <hi>Rigby,</hi> and ſome others
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:42082:148"/>of them into his Houſe, then other private Perſons gave Entertainment to the reſt. After this my Brother did go to <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and in Priſon there, did viſit this <hi>Rigby</hi> and the reſt; ſo that after they were releaſed, upon their return, this <hi>Rigby</hi> gave an Account how kind a <hi>Quaker</hi> had been, in giving him Entertainment, and Viſiting him, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> in Priſon, whom he formerly had been ſo Unkind unto, and dealt ſo Unchriſtianly with: So that this my Brothers Hoſpitality to him (who exerciſed Cruelty when he had Power) in the time of his Diſtreſs, did demonſtrate my Brother to be a true Follower of Chriſt, and one that had learned to do Good, and to extend Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to ſuch as had been Evil-minded, and greatly made their Cruelty manifeſt. This Account I received from Friends,</p>
